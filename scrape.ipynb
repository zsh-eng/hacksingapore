      "Habits to embrace in your financial journey By Lorna Tan\n",
      "Head, Financial Planning Literacy  If you’ve only got a minute:  Are you thinking of getting married, funding your kids’ education, and retiring comfortably? Whatever your goals are for the future, having a robust financial plan will ensure you are on track to achieving them. It requires regular reviews so that resources and goals are kept in check, and modifications to the plan can be carried out. By doing so, you’ll be able to make more informed decisions for tomorrow, today. Here are 3 insights in a recent research paper in the DBS NAV Financial Health Series that indicated the importance of financial knowledge and having a plan in place. The series analysed aggregated and anonymised data insights from 1.2 million DBS retail customers in May 2023 relative to May 2022.  Holistic financial planning A financial plan cannot be reduced to a single stock idea or a single investment strategy. A holistic plan requires a “helicopter” or comprehensive view of your financial circumstances as the basis for a sound financial plan. Just like a successful organisation cannot operate in silos, a holistic financial plan allows you to understand how a financial decision you make affect other areas of your lives. By viewing each financial decision as part of a whole, there is greater clarity on how it impacts your life goals. This offers a peace of mind that you can adapt more easily to life changes while keeping your life goals intact. Broadly, holistic financial planning covers the areas of credit management, insurance, investment, home planning, retirement & estate planning. Such a plan offers a clear direction, and you will have a better understanding of your financial resources, risk profile, are able to make informed financial decisions, and take suitable steps to achieve your objectives. It also moves the emphasis away from the objective of solely generating returns to that of a goals-based mindset, that is, meeting short term and long-term financial goals. When you understand your reasons why you want to achieve certain goals – whether it’s to buy a house, fund your kids’ education, or to retire comfortably – the holistic approach becomes more sustainable and effective.  Essential habits to build At DBS, we encourage you to inculcate 4 money habits in your financial journey: Save, Protect, Grow, and Retire. You can always start small with achievable objectives and take it step by step.  1. Save Have your heard of the Pay Yourself First guideline (setting aside savings/investments before spending) to saving before you spend? Doing so and tracking your monthly expenses will go a long way to help you cut back on discretionary spend and save more. Be more conscious of your spending as daily indulgences and irrational spending can easily consume a large part of your monthly budget.  Credit cards can get you more out of your spending by offering miles or cashback when you pay in full and before the due date. Read more: How much emergency cash is enough?  Find out more about: DBS Multiplier  2. Protect Insurance is crucial to counter life’s curveballs and offers cover to yourself and loved ones should you lose your income and/or chalk up unexpected expenses from illness, disability, accidents, or premature death. A top priority is to have suitable hospitalisation & surgical coverage that allows you to reduce out-of-pocket costs in the event of a medical crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "A general guideline is to spend no more than 15% of your take-home pay on insurance protection. However, bundled products (e.g. Whole life insurance) may exceed this cap as they contain both protection and investment elements.  Consider coverage in 6 key areas (health, death, critical illness, mortgage, disability, and general) to mitigate life risks that could derail your financial plan.   Read more: Insurance needs for different life stages Find out more about: Insuring with DBS 3. Grow To counter inflation and longevity risks, not investing is a risk. Build wealth by buying quality assets – equities, bonds, insurance or unit trusts – and allow time for them to compound and grow. Investment options that range from low to high risk include endowment policies, annuities, Singapore Government Securities, fixed income, funds, equities, and real estate.  Do your due diligence before investing and understand approaches like dollar-cost averaging and the importance of staying invested. Learn about different investment products as well as strategies you can employ to build and grow a diversified investment portfolio. Read More: Investing according to your changing life stages  Find out more about: Investing with DBS  4. Retire Retirement planning starts with understanding the lifestyle we desire and building passive income flows to fund your basic and lifestyle needs. Basic needs should be funded by more stable income flows from safer products like the Central Provident Fund (CPF) LIFE scheme, annuities, and fixed income products, while lifestyle needs can be funded by more variable income flows from higher risk products.  Set up a sound estate plan that includes tools like a will, CPF Nomination, Lasting Power of Attorney, Trust (if required), and an Advanced Medical Directive. Read more: 5 tips to retire well  Find out more about: Retirement planning with DBS  Government schemes The foundation of a retirement plan would typically include your CPF savings and the projected monthly cash payouts from the national annuity CPF LIFE scheme. The Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) can also be included in your financial plan. To recap, SRS withdrawals can start from the statutory retirement age (currently age 63) at the time of your first SRS contribution.  By investing both CPF and SRS balances, you can take advantage of the power of compounding over a long investment horizon and boost future income flows.

      "Guide for young adults: Planning for milestones  If you’ve only got a minute:  As you embark on your journey towards independence, it's crucial to lay a strong financial foundation. From your first paycheck to preparing for retirement, each milestone holds key financial considerations that shape your financial well-being. Planning ahead for milestones ensure a smooth transition into adulthood, setting the stage for long-term success. First paycheck Receiving your first paycheck is thrilling as it marks the beginning of your financial journey. The transition from receiving an allowance from your parents to managing your own finances can be both liberating and challenging. While it may be tempting to indulge and tick off some items on your wish list (car or first luxury item), it's crucial to approach your income with a sense of responsibility and foresight.  Firstly, you might want to address any outstanding student loan and formulate a plan to pay them off in a timely manner. Assess and take charge of your insurance and health plans by reviewing any existing coverage you may have through your parents and determine whether it meets your current needs. Consider taking over the responsibility of paying for your own insurance premiums too. Be sure to check if your employer offers corporate insurance benefits. If so, familiarise yourself with the coverage details. If it’s insufficient and non-portable, explore obtaining a separate hospitalisation plan to ensure comprehensive protection. Taking proactive steps to manage your insurance will help you avoid large medical expenses if sickness or hospitalisation occurs. Read more:\n",

      "Guide to choosing an Integrated Shield Plan Prioritise savings over spending by adopting the “Pay Yourself First” approach. Allocate a portion of your income (10% of your salary or more) towards savings and gradually build up an emergency fund consisting of at least 3 to 6 months of expenses. Not only are you cultivating a good saving habit, this safety net can also provide peace of mind in unexpected situations where you need cash urgently. Read more: Making Financial Planning Simple Think about establishing a budget that aligns with your financial goals and priorities. Categorise your expenses, including essentials (needs) like rent, utilities, and groceries, as well as any discretionary spending on non-essential items (wants).

The Plan & Invest tab on DBS digibank can help you track your saving and spending patterns so you can gain better control over your finances. Read more: Track your savings and spending with digibank  Wedding Planning for a wedding can be both thrilling and financially demanding, especially if it coincides with big-ticket purchases like your first home. A wedding typically costs around $30,000 to $50,000 and can easily go up to $100,000 (or more), depending on the scale of the event. The choice of venue, guest count, catering packages, wedding attire and the level of customisation all contribute to the overall expense. For example, opting for a popular or upscale venue, inviting a larger number of guests, and choosing premium catering services can notably increase costs. Other examples include the hiring of photographers/videographers and/or wedding planner, bridal package (wedding outfits), entertainment choices (emcee, live band, photobooth) and décor (wedding flowers, car decoration). Since a wedding involves significant expenses, you may consider getting a credit card that offers rebates (or miles) to get more bang for your buck. Set a realistic budget, and identify what’s important to have at the wedding, and how much you can comfortably spend to prevent unnecessary financial strain. More importantly, avoid resorting to a personal loan - by spending within your means and sticking to your budget - as it can lead to debt and unnecessary stress. After all, wedding is for a day while a marriage is for a lifetime. Start saving as early as possible to have more time to accumulate funds for your big day. Consider having a separate wedding savings account to better track your savings progress. Take advantage of the compounding interest from higher interest savings account (DBS Multiplier) to grow your savings faster. Read more:\n",

      "How can Multiplier work for you if you are in your 30s?  First Home Your first home is likely to be one of the most significant purchases in your lifetime, and a major milestone often linked to marriage or simply wanting a place of your own. Before buying a home, consider your budget, type of property, and location preferences. Other factors that impact home prices are amenities and the remaining lease, to name a few. Start by assessing your affordability by considering various expenses such as the down payment, option fees, stamp duties, legal fees, potential renovation costs, and monthly mortgage repayments. From here, you can decide what type of flat you can afford and how much you should start saving. If you're still unsure about which types of properties (HDB, Executive Condominium, Condo/Landed) you can afford, the DBS MyHome planning tool can help you work out the sums and find a home that meets your budget and preferences. You may also want to assess the future development plans in the area (resale value) and explore various loan and financing options such as available government schemes or grants for financial assistance if you’ve set your mind on buying a BTO, HDB resale or executive condominium (EC).

      "Your guide to home affordability in Singapore  First child Having a child is a lifelong commitment. From the time you discover you're expecting until your bundle of joy arrives and beyond, there are costs at every step. Begin by addressing 2 key expenses: maternity costs and delivery fees. From routine check-ups, screenings and tests to antenatal supplements that are crucial for a healthy pregnancy, each step requires careful budgeting and it doesn’t stop here. Delivery costs can vary based on several factors, including the type of delivery, the hospital or clinic chosen, and any additional medical services or complications that may arise during the childbirth process. Do note that private hospitals typically cost more. How long you stay in the hospital depends on whether you have a normal (2 days) or Caesarean delivery (3 to 5 days). You can expect to pay at least $6,000 for a 2-day stay at a Class A ward in government hospitals (KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital). Examples of MediSave Claimable Under the MediSave Maternity Package Source: Health Hub The good news is that you can defray some of these costs with the Medisave Maternity Package. The MediSave withdrawal limits are: Some other important benefits include the Medisave Grant for Newborns (to help cover healthcare expenses) and The Baby Bonus Scheme (to help you manage the costs of raising a child). Read more: Why open a savings account even if your child has CDA Some other costs include postnatal services, such as hiring a confinement nanny or a full-time helper. Ongoing costs for diapers, clothes, crib, stroller, car seat, and infant care should also be anticipated. By sorting out these money matters in advance with a well organised budget, it sets the stage for parenthood. Read more: Young Parents: Planning for finances in the now and future Next, ensure that your family and child are well protected with the appropriate insurance coverage. Since you now have dependents, you may consider life or term insurance that will provide payouts should you pass on. Beyond replacing lost income and daily expenses, it addresses key needs such as funding education, settling outstanding debts such as home loans, and covering funeral expenses. Read more: Insurance needs for different life stages Investing in your child's future Tertiary education can be expensive, especially when inflation is taken into consideration. Start planning for your child’s future by setting aside funds for childcare and education. One way is to park these savings in an endowment (savings) insurance policy. Endowment plans allow you to save in a disciplined manner while providing some guaranteed returns. Lets assume that your child is now 6 years old and you want to prepare for her university education in 18 years’ time. You can consider an endowment fund such as SavvySpring (II) to supplement that savings goal so that when it matures 12 years later, it aligns with her university education. Read more:\n",

      "Growing your child’s savings  Securing your future Next, focus on growing your wealth by investing as well as to ensure that your money doesn’t lose its purchasing value over time due to inflation. Investing is an effective way to build or preserve your wealth. Some common investment products include structured deposits, exchange traded funds (ETFs), Real Estate Investment Trusts (Reits), bonds, unit trusts, equities/stocks as well as gold. It is recommended to build a diversified portfolio of different asset classes as this helps to spread the risk.

      "One financial tip that changed our lives  If you’ve only got a minute:  The economic outlook for 2024 looks exciting with rising expectations of the US Fed reducing rates in the second quarter.  Meanwhile, interest rates continue to stay elevated, and the higher cost of living remains a concern for most people. In times like these, we need to continue to exercise prudence in spending, ensure we have sufficient emergency cash and stick to a long-term investing plan to grow our wealth and build our retirement nest egg. The start of a new year is a great time to review our finances and set new goals for the year ahead. This year, we have invited financial planning literacy specialists from the DBS Financial Planning Literacy team to share one financial tip each that has made a substantial impact on their money management.  Lorna Tan Prior to joining DBS, Lorna was the Invest Editor at The Straits Times for 16 years, covering finance and consumer protection issues. She has won numerous awards for excellence in financial reporting and public service journalism, and is the author of four bestsellers: Money Smart-Own Your Financial Destiny, Retire Smart- Financial Planning Made Easy, More Talk Money and Talk Money. As a wage earner, there’s only so much I can earn and save. This is why I realised that I would need to do more to be able to mitigate longevity and inflation concerns, and be able to fund my desired retirement lifestyle and that of my parents. It helps that I have a money personality that naturally gravitates to being a disciplined saver with an innate curiousity on what’s new in the investment landscape. Change is the only constant so I keep myself plugged in by researching, reading, listening to podcasts and attending financial-related seminars. While I am mindful of my short- and mid-term financial goals, I have adopted a long-term diversified investment approach to achieve financial freedom. For me, financial planning must be deliberate and quantifiable, and I continue to track and refine it over the years. I get restless when I have too much idle cash lying around and would constantly seek opportunities - after ensuring I have adequate insurance protection of course – to make my money work harder for me. Diversification is key. This includes optimising government schemes like CPF and SRS, and having a mix of asset classes like equities, fixed income, real estate, and private equity products. Lynette Tan Lynette started her career in a brokerage and has more than a decade of experience in the financial services industry in areas spanning personal finance and investment advisory. She is passionate about empowering people with personal finance knowledge to help them live a better life.  Coming from a brokerage background, my first foray into investing was to buy stocks. While it was a good start to break the inertia of investing, it was hard for a beginner to pick the right stocks. I have suffered losses over time, but also made gains over “hype” stocks through the years. My one financial tip is to leave the stock-picking to experts and invest on a regular basis. I set aside a fixed amount every month to invest in a broad-based Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) so that I can have a peace of mind without worrying about suffering substantial losses on a single stock.  Putting aside a fixed amount each month for investments also helped me build discipline, similar to how we build discipline in savings. By automating the process, I don’t even need a reminder to invest every month. Doing this also helps me feel better about not having my savings eroded by inflation if I simply leave them in a deposit account. Jermaine Koh Jermaine joined the financial industry since 2011 and is in her 8th year with DBS. She joined the financial literacy team in 2022.  The switch in career has made me more mindful of my expenditure. To gain better control of my finances, I have started tracking my money in/out religiously using budgeting tools on my mobile phone. This allows me to better understand my spending patterns and to plan my budget better. Doing so enables me to stay grounded and spend within my means. I am also better at prioritising needs over wants. This is way better than relying on “girl math” and just spending/saving blindly (which was what I did before). Instead of indulging in wants, I try to set aside money to invest in low-risk instruments such as T-bills, bonds and fixed deposits, while I explore suitable higher risk investments. It’s a tiny step to growing my wealth, but it’s better late than never! That said, I’d still like to reward myself once in a while. Instead of buying things (which I used to before), I prefer setting aside a travel budget. I have realised that the “happiness” that physical possessions provide, is temporary. Travelling, on the other hand, allows me to invest in time spent with my loved ones and/or myself and these experiences are unique and irreplaceable. While the process of tracking expenses and budgeting might appear dull initially, it is crucial because it empowers you to gain control over your financial situation. By keeping a close eye on where your money goes, you can make informed decisions, identify unnecessary spending, and allocate funds for your priorities. This financial discipline not only ensures that you meet your financial goals but also provides the flexibility to treat yourself occasionally without compromising your financial stability. In essence, it's about finding a balance between responsible money management and enjoying the pleasures in life. Gwendoline Tan Gwen has more than 8 years of experience in the finance industry, mainly in business development, and as a relationship manager and has joined the DBS financial literacy team since 2022.  This simple, but important financial tip, was not one that I learnt from my years in finance, but rather one that was taught to me by my parents since I was in school. It is so simple and practical that even a primary school child (i.e. me) could put it into practice, and has remained relevant in my financial planning up till today. When I was a child, my parents would give me a little more pocket money than I needed each day – say 10 or 20 cents – and let me decide how to use it. I could have bought myself a sweet treat daily but was instead always encouraged to save/ put it away first, so that I could build up the savings in my piggy bank, in case I needed spare cash one day. This is the basic principle behind “paying yourself first”. It is common for many to think that “paying yourself first” equates to “giving yourself a treat” each time your monthly salary comes in. In reality, deciding on and consciously setting aside an amount of money each month the moment your paycheck comes in is ensuring that your future self is taken care of. Navin Sregantan Navin has been with the financial planning literacy team with DBS since 2020 and works on various projects aimed at making holistic financial planning content more accessible to all DBS clients and members of the public. Previously, he was a journalist with The Business Times and The Straits Times covering listed companies, financial markets, investments and corporate social responsibility initiatives.  The financial tip that changed my view on financial wellness is that investing should be treated as a journey and not a sprint. Just like in life, there will be lots of ups and downs, as well as disappointments and moments of triumph. What’s most important is to stay focused on meeting your long-term goals and steer the course. As a first jobber, it helps to start investing as soon as you can, and I probably sound like a broken record here but “time in the market is better than timing the market”. In other words, the best day to start investing is today. This doesn’t mean that you must make a large, lump-sum investment. Instead, get into the habit of setting aside money to make regular investments through dollar-cost averaging. It’s ok to start small and build your confidence and knowledge up. Don’t be obsessed with trying to successfully time the market. This is very difficult to accomplish and even highly skilled professionals often fail to achieve this. Moreover, efficient financial markets often price in information so quickly that investors are unable to perfectly buy at its trough and sell at its peak. What is most important is to have skin in the game by being invested. The global economy historically sees longer periods of growth than recession, and stock markets see longer “bull” phases (uptrends) than “bear” phases (downtrends). Much like in life, you will most certainly make mistakes in your investing journey. You might lose confidence and feel that investing is not for you but don’t give up too easily due to these setbacks. Don’t let bad experiences dissuade you from investing. Instead, focus on learning from your mistakes as after all, we tend to learn more from our mistakes than our successes. By learning from your mistakes, understanding yourself better and being more well-researched, you have the opportunity to be “greedy when others are fearful”. Market peaks and troughs are expected. They are caused by various factors, such as economic indicators, political developments, and company announcements. When markets go awry, it is easy to panic and sell your investment to trim losses. But cutting loss too early may prevent you from potentially enjoying a price recovery later. Shawn Lee Shawn has a decade of experience in financial advisory and education.

      "Financial spring cleaning for 2024 By Lorna Tan  If you’ve only got a minute:  Though inflation has eased, core inflation – which excludes accommodation and private transport - in Singapore is still at an elevated level of about 3.2%. No doubt the cost of living will continue to be a big worry for this year. Contributing factors range from the GST hike to 9% here and the ongoing wars in Ukraine and Gaza leading to supply disruptions. But it is not all gloom and doom. Instead of fretting over the things we can’t control let us do something about the things we can, like reviewing our budget and having a comprehensive financial plan. Higher prices mean exercising more prudence and being more strategic about how we spend to stretch our income. Here are 8 tips to spring clean your finances. 1. Reducing discretionary spend Our transportation, electricity, petrol, food, and Netflix bills have inched up. With the GST hike to 9% from 8%, goods and services will cost more. Fortunately, the government has enhanced the Assurance Package for most Singaporeans to delay the impact for them effectively by 5 years. For the low income, the impact on them will be delayed for 10 years. Still, it is timely to review our saving and spending habits to inculcate a thrifty habit and learn to defer gratification for bigger future financial rewards. After all, our experience of living within the constraints of social distancing due to the Covid-19 pandemic has taught us that it is possible to reduce discretionary spend when the need arises. Use the Plan & Invest tab in digibanking – a digital financial and retirement advisory tool - to help you keep track of your spending in different categories and make realistic adjustments. With the “Your Net Worth” and Cashflow trackers in the tool, it’s easy to check how much you’re spending in various categories. Ensure that you have at least 3 to 6 months of emergency cash set aside for the rainy day. In the light of higher prices, review if it is still adequate for you and your dependants. Several saving strategies adopted during the crisis that can become long-term habits over time. This is partly because the new normal will see more people working from home for longer periods of time compared with previously. They include cooking and eating at home, group tuition, self-care, less consumption on cosmetics and apparel, buying in bulk, doing away with unnecessary subscription services, a car or domestic help, or swap out brand-name items for generic ones where possible. Read more: Let’s get better at money: Beyond budgeting  2. Assess protection needs The start of the year is a good time to have a thorough audit to assess your insurance plans and cover. The Plan & Invest can help you identify and close any insurance gaps at your fingertips, taking into account your existing insurance plans and number of dependants. Any additional regular premiums should be affordable and sustainable. Healthcare planning is important so do consider if you need to upgrade to a hospitalisation plan like an Integrated Shield Plan (IP) and an IP rider, as well as a critical illness cover. If you are turning 30 this year, you will automatically be covered by long-term care insurance CareShield Life, regardless of pre-existing medical conditions and disability. Be aware that the annual premiums will be deducted from your CPF MediSave Account till age 67. If you have budget constraints and/or prefer to build insurance coverage a bit at a time, you may consider “micro-insurance”. It can be useful especially as a starting point for those who are first-time buyers or the underinsured, as the plan is low cost, requires a relatively shorter commitment, and can be thought of as additional coverage to supplement one’s overall coverage. Such “micro-insurance” coverage can help these people meet their immediate needs and get more familiar with the product before opting for a more comprehensive plan, while building up his/her affordability. However, do bear in mind that the small cover and duration may not be enough, especially if you have dependents and are vulnerable to higher risks, such as those with pre-existing medical conditions. 3. Review your investment portfolio When constructing a portfolio, asset allocation and diversification are key as it is very unlikely that a single asset class will deliver the highest return all the time. So, combining different asset classes in a portfolio can diversify the risks and improve returns over the longer term. Furthermore, review and rebalance your plan as personal circumstances change. It is a good idea to review your portfolio at least once a year and consider rebalancing whenever you go through major life events, such as getting married or having a baby. Rebalancing means that selling some stocks and buying some bonds, or vice versa, so that your portfolio’s asset allocation is aligned to your risk profile and matches the level of returns you’re trying to achieve. All investors want to make more precise and better-informed decisions with their money. The Plan & Invest tab enables customers to receive advice that leverages AI models to provide precise and right-sized investment recommendations. They only need to answer a few key questions to assess their investment profile, all done in accordance with regulatory safeguards. This helps customers remove guesswork along with investment biases, which in turn, widens the pool of investment solutions suited to them. It can help customers uncover blind spots too. If you have never invested or are relatively new to investing, consider starting small and building your investments over time. This will also help you build investing discipline by setting aside money regularly for investments. By adopting the dollar-cost averaging strategy - where you invest a fixed sum regularly into the same choice of investment over a period - you accumulate more units when prices are low and less units when prices are high. Over time, the average cost of your investment could potentially be lower versus a lump sum investment. The advantage of using an RSP is that it avoids the pitfalls of timing the market and the low entry investment sum makes investing accessible to newbie investors. For example, consider investing in a Regular Savings Plan (RSP) which lets you invest a fixed sum consistently. You can choose to invest in equities, exchange traded funds (ETFs) or unit trusts (UTs), helping you accumulate units of funds steadily and progressively. DBS Invest-Saver, for example, lets you buy ETFs and unit trusts from as little as $100 a month. Read more: What to know about dollar-cost averaging  4. Invest for the long-term Retirement may seem far away for young investors but making time your ally is the best way to reap the power of compounding and achieve financial freedom. Adopting a long-term investing approach as part of your overall financial plan is prudent so that you do not lose sight of your future financial security while planning for your short- and mid-term goals. This will help you to be more focused on riding the ups and downs of the equity market and accepting short-term risks to achieve potentially higher returns over a longer period of time. Check out the Retirement Portfolio in the robo-advisory platform DBS digiPortfolio, which helps you to glide into retirement with ease, not stress. It automatically adjusts your investment mix over time, aiming to grow your investment in assets with higher growth potential (like stocks) when you are further from retirement, and reduce your risk by investing in less risky assets (like bonds) as you age. At retirement, you can choose how you want to enjoy your payouts, that is, how much and the frequency. It has no lock-in period or penalties. To recap, digiPortfolio is a digital platform that provide automated, algorithm-driven investing services in the form of pre-defined portfolios with pre-selected instruments based on risk rating. With our hybrid human-robo digiPortfolio, novice investors can rest easy as it takes the guesswork out of stock-picking to have your funds professionally managed by our wealth management experts. For seasoned investors it can be a low-cost way to complement your other investments as part of a long-term strategy as both our Asia and Global portfolios are well-diversified. It’s a relatively simpler way to invest and eliminates the need for investors to spend time monitoring the markets by leaving this to the experts. 5. Review home loans and cost of buying a home When inflation rates are up, the banks’ interest rates have risen too, which will impact people who take out home loans. Homeowners should re-assess the interest rate of their existing home loans and explore loan options where they can enjoy potential interest savings. In the light of rising interest rates, a fixed rate home loan might provide one with a greater peace of mind. Another option is to reduce your housing loan – say with your annual bonus - especially if your housing loan allows for partial repayment with no penalty. You can use the DBS Home Loan Savings Calculator to get clarity on your home loans and calculate potential savings by repricing with your existing financier, or by refinancing with another bank. This tool is also open to non-DBS customers, and they can glean insights on how the principal and interest components will change throughout the life of the home loan. The holistic guide covers national schemes (including CPF, MediShield Life and CareShield Life), low-cost products, and actionable rules-of-thumb for consumers to self-assess, identify, and close their money gaps. Come early 2024, it will be further developed into six short guides addressing the needs of individuals in different life stages.  For new borrowers, determine how much money you can borrow. In the light of the latest property cooling measures, the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) has been tightened to cap your total monthly debt repayments at 55% of your gross monthly income. This means new mortgages cannot cause borrowers’ total monthly loan repayments to exceed 55% of monthly income. Factor in additional payments such as property tax, property agent commissions, condo maintenance fees, insurance, home repairs or improvements, property loan interest and so on. Include other upfront costs, such as the down payment, stamp duties, cost of furnishings and any renovations. Singapore citizens will now pay an ABSD rate of 20% for their second residential property, and 30% for their third and subsequent residential property. This is up from the previous rates of 17% and 25% respectively. The ABSD rates for permanent residents buying a second or a third and subsequent residential property has been increased to 30% and 35% respectively.  6. Optimise CPF accounts Maximise your nest-egg and that of your loved ones by topping up Central Provident Fund (CPF) accounts to leverage attractive interest rates and compounding. I would usually top up my CPF accounts and that of my loved ones in January to kickstart the compounding, rather than wait till the end of the year. This year, the CPF Basic Retirement Sum is $102,900, the Full Retirement Sum is $205,800 while the Enhanced Retirement Sum is $308,700. Do note that you can enjoy a higher tax relief of up to $8,000 when you top up to your own Special/Retirement Account and MediSave Account; and an additional tax relief of up to $8,000 when you top up your loved ones’ Special/Retirement Account and MediSave Account. The Matched Retirement Savings Scheme was implemented in 2021 to help senior Singaporeans with Retirement Account savings less than the Basic Retirement Sum, to save more for retirement. Under the scheme, the Government will match every dollar of cash top-ups made to eligible members under the CPF Retirement Sum Topping-Up scheme up to an annual cap of $600, for 5 years. If you are below age 55, check out the “Your CPF” feature on the Plan & Invest tab in digibank to find out the CPF Retirement Sums for your age cohort, and get insights on how to close your gaps early. To help middle-income Singaporeans save more for their retirement and keep pace with rising salaries, the CPF monthly salary ceiling will be raised from $6,000 to $8,000 in 4 steps by 2026. From 1st September 2023, the CPF monthly salary ceiling was raised by $300 to $6,300. Do note that it has gone up to $6,800 from 1st January 2024, and the next 2 increases would happen thereafter - to $7,400 from 1st January 2025 and to $8,000 from 1st January 2026. The Government has said that there will be no change to the CPF annual salary ceiling of $102,000. Read more: How the CPF salary ceiling changes affect you 7. Contribute to Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) and invest Use SRS to defer taxes that would be paid in higher-income tax brackets in your peak earning years. By doing so, you can pay taxes in lower tax brackets during your retirement years when income is lower or nil. Parking your savings in SRS not only makes you eligible for some tax relief but you can also stretch your dollar by investing your money. After all, leaving it idle only earns you a paltry 0.05% per annum. You can use SRS funds to buy a wide range of investments, including insurance plans such as single-premium endowment policies, unit trusts or shares. An SRS contribution made on or before Dec 31 will qualify for tax relief in the following Year of Assessment. The prevailing cap is $15,300 a year for Singaporeans and permanent residents, and $35,700 for foreigners. The minimum age to open an SRS account is 18. If you do not have an SRS account, consider setting one up and contributing $1. Doing so will enable you to lock in the penalty-free withdrawal age at age 63, as the statutory retirement age will increase in the near future. The penalty-free withdrawal period starts when you make your first withdrawal at or after the statutory retirement age that was prevailing when you made your first SRS contribution. 8. Have a complete view of your finances The start of a new year is an opportune time to review your financial health and objectives via a financial plan. The best way to do this is to have a comprehensive view of your finances so that you can make informed and better financial decisions. With the Singapore Financial Data Exchange (SGFinDex), consumers can easily consolidate their different bank accounts and financial information from Central Provident Fund Board, HDB, Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore, Central Depository and insurance firms in one place, for greater clarity of their financial situation. The Plan & Invest tab enables you to connect to SGFinDex, so your financial information will be pulled onto the platform, with your consent. It will then make use of your data and offer comprehensive insights on your finances, and help you identify and close insurance and investment gaps, as well as map your future. It has an investment simulator as well as cashflow projection capabilities so you can visualise how your savings can grow with investments into the future. So far, more than 3 million customers have used the digital advisory tool. Ready to start?

      "Seeking sound financial advice By Lorna Tan  If you’ve only got a minute:  As the world becomes increasingly digitally driven, more and more people, especially young adults, are turning to social media channels for quick access to financial knowledge, advice, and perform transactions. But are such channels more risk than reward? A recent survey finds that the proportion of Singaporeans aged in their 20s who are on track to meeting their investment goals has plummeted to under a third (32%) in 2023, from 75% in 2019. Where can young adults go to seek helpful and constructive guidance on their financial goals? 1. Social Media There is a plethora of financial information on social media channels such as Instagram, TikTok, Telegram and so on. However, it is important to discern what is good and value-added from sub-standard financial advice and misrepresentation. The person offering the advice may not be qualified, or may have their own agenda such as pushing selective products to earn kickbacks. If you do follow the right folks, you will be in a better place. Portals run by the likes of Singapore’s national financial education programme MoneySense, and DBS Financial Planning portal, will provide the necessary financial knowledge on various topics to empower yourself.  Do note that the tips and hacks in these portals may not be customised to your needs. It is important to evaluate such suggestions before acting on them.  2. Chat GPT Responses on artificial intelligence-powered platform ChatGPT are based on past data, so they are only as good as the information that is available to the chatbot. If the data is limited, incomplete, biased, or inaccurate, the quality of responses will be affected accordingly. How the questions are being phrased is another factor. Ultimately, ChatGPT is not designed to provide financial advice as it is typically generic, limited in the application of local schemes and not comprehensive — but it can support learning. 3. Digital tools Technology is an enabler that can be used to make informed decisions and be updated on market trends and information. A suitable digital financial advisory tool is a great starting point for anyone looking to get a handle on their financial situation. For instance, the Plan tabs on the POSB and DBS digibank apps is auto-populated with your financial information, such as cashflows and investments. The Plan tabs on these apps also empower you with personalised insights and tips, which enhances your decision-making.  Even if you prefer to engage the services of a human adviser, digital tools such as these are helpful in to kickstarting the fact-finding process on your financial health. To gain greater clarity, sync with SGFinDex (Singapore Financial Data Exchange) using your SingPass via the financial planning application or website from participating financial institutions, like the DBS’s Plan tab.  Doing so  will enable you to consolidate all your financial information from Central Provident Fund (CPF), Housing and Development Board, Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore, CDP, as well as other banks and insurers to give you a comprehensive view of your financial health. By better understanding your overall financial health, you can make more holistic decisions about your money.  4. Financial advisory representatives While there are advantages to getting online financial advice, such as potentially feeling less pressure to purchase products, some may still prefer human interaction and the reassurance that they are able to reach out to a customer service representative when necessary. Unless you have a good grasp of financial education, are an active saver and are disciplined in managing money, you will likely need professional advice on understanding your financial objectives, how to quantify them more accurately, mitigating against your saving and investing biases, and sticking to your financial plan. This is where financial advisers come in.  When selecting a financial advisory representative, consider their credentials and track record, the range of solutions they provide, their trustworthiness, how they are remunerated (salaried, commissions or fee-based), and the level of service you require. 5. Basic Financial Planning Guide Planning for financial wellness can be overwhelming, especially for the uninitiated. As such, the Singapore Government and industry associations, including banks, have come together to develop an easy-to-use Basic Financial Planning Guide. Launched in October 2023, the guide’s aim is to enable everyone to enhance their financial health by making financial planning more accessible to the masses and encouraging them to take simple steps towards doing so. The comprehensive guide provides a consolidated view on the diverse needs of financial planning at various life stages — from fresh entrants to the workforce, to working adults with kids, to pre-retirees and retirees). It offers recommended levels of emergency cash, protection levels, investment, retirement, and estate planning considerations.\n",

Come early 2024, it will be further developed into six short guides addressing the needs of individuals in different life stages.  While the guide is broadly applicable to most, it is not exhaustive and may not cater to every individual’s specific needs, circumstances, and preferences.  It remains important to analyse your own needs and consult a professional for a customised financial plan. 6. Family and friends It is well and good if your circle of family and friends is made up of experienced financial experts. If not, it will be prudent to rely on them more for the open discussion and sharing of ideas, instead of soliciting hard-and-fast advice. Such discussions, just like those found on online forums, can help to ascertain your beliefs and raise questions that did not occur to you. 7. Get educated Research has shown that financial education can substantially impact the financial wellness by correcting misunderstandings and inculcating good money habits. Be on the continuous lookout for content, workshops and seminars that can give a boost to your financial know-how. For instance, Singapore’s national financial education programme MoneySense aims to help Singaporeans manage their money well and make sound financial decisions on their own. The CPF Board also has information on its many schemes and how to optimise them. Rather than relying completely on external sources, having some knowledge yourself will give you a better idea on whether you are getting sound advice and recommendations. Ready to start?

      "Making Financial Planning Simple By Lorna Tan  If you’ve only got a minute:  Much has been written and talked about on the need for financial planning. An ongoing process, financial planning looks at your entire financial picture to come up with steps and solutions to achieve your short-, medium-, and long-term goals. In doing so, you will have greater peace of mind knowing that you can meet current needs as well as being able to fund your kids’ education and desired retirement lifestyle. But for the uninitiated, the thought of planning for financial wellness can be overwhelming and most do not know where to begin. Still, it is often said that when you fail to plan, you are planning to fail. Knowing this, the government and industry associations including the banks have come together to develop an easy-to-use Basic Financial Planning Guide comprising 6 short guides that are customised to meet the needs of individuals in different life stages. The aim is to enable everyone to start planning and enhance their financial health by making financial planning more accessible to the masses and encouraging them to take some simple actions. What is the Basic Financial Planning Guide While guides on financial planning are not new, the new Basic Financial Planning Guide distinguishes itself through its comprehensive nature. It aims to provide a consolidated view on the diverse needs of financial planning at various life stages (from fresh entrant to the workforce and working adult with kids to pre-retirees and retirees). The holistic guide offers recommended levels of emergency cash, protection levels, investment, retirement, and estate planning considerations. It includes national schemes (like Central Provident Fund, MediShield Life and CareShield Life), low-cost protection and diversified investment product options, and actionable Rules of Thumb for consumers to self-assess, identify, and close their money gaps.  These Rules of Thumb equip Singaporeans with an easy way to get started on their financial journey and allow them to benchmark their current financial situation against the Rules of Thumb. The inclusion of government schemes and low-cost product options can help Singaporeans fulfil their financial needs more efficiently. Guides for 6 Consumer Archetypes Launched in January 2024, the 6 short guides revolve around these consumer archetypes: Each guide comes with a case study that gives a breakdown of an individual’s monthly cashflows for financial planning, rules of thumb on emergency savings, protection and investments, as well as suggestions on product options and the affordable monthly cost. Factors to consider when using the Guide 1. Do a financial needs analysis The guide lays out basic and simple steps to set up a financial plan that are broadly applicable to most. This means that the guide may not cater to every individual’s specific needs, circumstances, and preferences. While it provides guidance on how you can meet your key and basic financial planning needs, it is not exhaustive. As such, consumers are strongly encouraged to do a financial needs analysis either by themselves or with a professional financial adviser to assess their situation, before making informed decisions on the steps to fulfil their financial objectives. 2. Deviation from Rules of Thumb As part of the financial needs analysis process, financial advisory representatives are required take into consideration the customer’s specific needs, and this could mean recommendations which deviate from the new guide. Of course, there should always be a reasonable basis for the financial advice and recommended solutions. For example, the level of adequate emergency funds could differ from person to person. While individuals who enjoy a steady paycheque can make do with at least 3 to 6 months of emergency cash, freelancers with unpredictable income may require 12 months or more to account for unexpected lull periods in their income. In the same vein, an individual’s insurance and investment needs will differ depending on his specific circumstances, such as affordability, number of dependants, risk profile and time horizon. This means he may require insurance covers that have lower or higher cover and/or risker investment solutions, than the rules of thumb indicated in the new guide. While the rule of thumb indicates spending up to 15% of salary on insurance protection (such as term and medical plans), do note that this excludes premiums for bundled products such as whole life insurance as they contain both investment and protection elements. Furthermore, Integrated Shield Plans may be a suitable additional health cover for those who desire a higher level of medical care.  3. Upgrade your knowledge and review your financial plan The new guide is an additional resource and an avenue to upgrade your financial literacy and build a strong financial foundation. Putting in place a good financial plan is a gift to your loved ones and to yourself. It is a prudent to constantly review your financial plan. For example, should you find that you have purchased more or less coverage compared to the guide’s Rules of Thumb, you may wish to review your needs and preferences, to determine if your existing coverage continues to suit your unique circumstances. After all, it is a good practice for consumers to adjust their insurance coverage at different life stages given that their needs and preferences would evolve over time. Reviewing your financial plan will also enable you to allocate and invest your financial resources in different asset classes for diversification, and build a portfolio that is better aligned to your situation, risk profile, objectives and time horizon. 4. Voluntary use of guide by industry players The use of the new guide is not a regulatory requirement. There is no breach of MAS’ laws and regulations for not using the guide. That said, many FA representatives already incorporate elements of the guide as part of their conversations with customers today, including DBS Bank. In fact, DBS’s comprehensive financial advisory process – via online and human-facing channels - is based on a robust financial planning model that has already taken into consideration the guide’s Rules and Thumb and more. DBS digital financial and retirement advisory tool – Plan & Invest tab on digibank – enables you to connect to SGFinDex, so your financial information from banks, CPF, HDB, IRAS, CDP, and insurers, will be pulled onto the platform, with your consent. The tool will offer comprehensive insights on your finances, and help you identify and close insurance and investment gaps, as well as map your future. It has an investment simulator as well as cashflow projection capabilities so you can visualise how your savings can grow with investments into the future. So far, 3 million customers have used the digital tool, of which more than one-third are active users monthly.  How do Singaporeans fare in financial health The National Financial Capability Survey conducted by MoneySense in 2021 found that Singapore residents generally adopted good financial behaviours in money management. But more need to take active financial planning steps as slightly more than half of the survey respondents had not developed a plan for retirement savings. Furthermore, the findings from DBS latest research paper “Between a rock and a hard place” underscore the importance of sustainable financial planning for everyone to enhance their wellbeing. This is particularly so for certain population segments, as relentless inflationary pressures and escalating expenses that outpace growth in wages lead to further erosion of savings.  The report analysed aggregated and anonymised data insights from 1.2 million DBS retail customers in May 2023 relative to May 2022. In particular, boomers, low-income customers and gig workers are most financially stretched. Contrary to other customers, the 3 groups saw expense-to-income ratios inch up to 86%, 93% and 112% in May 2023 respectively. This is significantly higher than that of the median customer at 57%. The report indicated that generally savings dipped but remain healthy, except for the low-income. The median customer saw their savings decline marginally from 3.7 to 3.5 months of expenses. Yet, savings for the low-income and gig workers could only last them 1.5 months and 1.7 months respectively, which is an area of concern. The launch of the new Basic Financial Planning Guide is timely and will go a long way to boost Singaporeans’ awareness of financial literacy and their financial security.

      "Between a rock and a hard place By Lorna Tan  If you’ve only got a minute:    The growth momentum has slowed as we move into a post-Covid era. Yet inflation, despite easing from last year’s peak, remains elevated. High inflation erodes everyone’s purchasing power, while high interest rates take a toll on the balance sheets of those with existing financial liabilities (for example, credit cards debt and mortgages). As a result, some customers (particularly gig workers, boomers, low- and middle-income earners) find their cashflows getting tighter and/or squeezed by higher debt payment like mortgages, due to higher interest rates. In fact, gig workers are the most financially stretched and their incomes were insufficient to cover their spending. Those who are financially savvy with cash are better positioned to leverage the higher interest rate environment. We saw customers’ investment flows shift towards short-duration risk-free assets, while riskier assets such as equities fell out of favour. Across all generations and income groups, investments moved towards fixed income securities in May 2023 versus May 2022, especially into Singapore Treasury bills (T-bills). This research paper “Between a rock and a hard place” is the 5th instalment in the DBS NAV Financial Health Series that analysed aggregated and anonymised data insights from 1.2 million DBS retail customers in May 2023 relative to May last year. It sheds light on the impact of high inflation and interest rates on financial wellness. The findings underscore the importance of sustainable financial planning for everyone to enhance their well being. This is particularly so for those who are caught between a rock and a hard place, as relentless inflationary pressures and escalating expenses that outpace growth in wages lead to further erosion of savings. Here are 8 key findings and 6 financial planning tips from this study. Expense-to-income (%), by generations    Savings (as defined by number of months of expenses), by income groups  Expense-to-income (%) of gig workers vs median customer in May 2023    % share of investment flows, by asset classes  Here are 6 tips to boost financial resilience for everyone, especially vulnerable groups like gig workers, boomers, low- and middle-income earners:  1. Grow income Upskill your capabilities by taking advantage of your SkillsFuture credits and continue to stay relevant and employable. Look beyond your comfort zone and consider job opportunities in other sectors. Eligible individuals can take advantage of government support schemes like Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) that empower workers to uplift their lives. WIS considers the worker’s age, employment status (employee or self-employed), and income when determining the disbursement amount. Side hustles can boost your income streams too. Try putting your baking skills to use by selling some of your home-baked cookies. If you are proficient in English, Chinese, and/or Mathematics, giving tuition in the evenings or during weekends can be a lucrative source of income. Love to create videos? You can sign up on freelancer platforms to earn some money and gain some job experience. Retirees are realising that working part-time helps to keep them mentally stimulated and connected to the community which enhances their general well-being. And the extra income helps to boost their nest egg so it can last longer to counter longevity and inflation risks. If you have saved up at least 3 to 6 months’ worth of monthly expenses as emergency cash, make your money work harder via higher yielding accounts and suitable investments that are aligned to your financial situation, risk profile and time horizon. With an inflation rate of 5% to 6% in Singapore, not taking any investment risk is a risk as your purchasing power will erode with idle cash. With rising interest rates, this is an opportune time for new investors to embark on their investing journey by dipping their toes in low-risk products that can offer decent yields. Backed by the Singapore Government, Singapore Government Securities (SGS), Singapore Savings Bonds and T-bills are examples of extremely low risk investment vehicles that offer good yields. As such, they are popular among beginners and investors as a means to diversify their portfolios. However, while they can form part of the fixed income allocation of your investment portfolio, do note that the steady returns from these instruments are unlikely to help you stay ahead of high inflation, nor offer compounding benefits. To grow your wealth in the long-term, build a diversified mix of assets that includes equities, and reap the benefits of compounding. Invest in yourself by upgrading your financial knowledge on how investments and insurance work and set up a comprehensive plan. 2. Cut discretionary spending With inflation eroding our purchasing power, we need to track our cashflows more diligently and reduce discretionary spend. While the DBS report showed that expense-to-income ratio has decreased for median customers compared to a year ago, we need to be mindful of lingering inflation and that income may not increase at the same rate in the coming year. Boomers and low-income customers are also seeing worsening wallet bandwidth, highlighting the need to reduce discretionary expenses. Going back to the basics of tracking your expenses and setting up a monthly budget can help rein in excess discretionary spending, and offer clarity on your money leaks. Use the “Plan” tab in DBS digibank to help you set up a budget and track your spending categories. Here are 4 ways to keep expenses manageable. 3. Manage credit wisely Although credit card usage has increased, the good news is that most customers are aware of the high interest chargeable on late credit card bill payments. Credit cards offer attractive benefits such as earning cashback, miles, rewards, and discounts on selected retailers. Make the best use by selecting credit cards that are aligned with your lifestyle spending and ensure that you keep expenses in check by setting a suitable credit limit. Most importantly, always pay your monthly bills in full and before the due date, to avoid hefty penalties. Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) schemes have gained gaining popularity among consumers, but there are pros and cons. They can be useful in the event you need to buy an expensive item immediately but want to reduce the amount of expenditure or credit for a period of time. For the younger generation who do not have substantial savings, using BNPL schemes can enable them to make necessary big-ticket purchases such as laptops without the need for a credit card. However, they may also give a false sense of financial security. By turning a large expense into something more “affordable” as the payments are stretched over time, it may result in impulsive buying and overspending. Furthermore, it becomes harder for you to track your exact expenses as well, resulting in potentially mismanaging your budget and finances. If late payments are incurred, additional charges will be imposed adding to the outstanding debt. Generally, BNPL plans are probably not a good idea for those who are often low in cash. Ultimately, affordability is key. Do ensure that the purchase is within your budget and that you will be able to repay them. Remember that paying your purchases in smaller amounts over time does not work for everyone. It will be more prudent to save harder and make these purchases later with money you already have. Loans or purchases funded by credit can accumulate through interest charges and fees, becoming a constant source of distress. If you find that your debts are spiralling out of control, you may want to consider the Debt Consolidation Plan (DCP) offered by banks or the Debt Management Programme (DMP) from Credit Counselling Singapore. 4. Manage home loans efficiently Rising mortgage rates have made headlines since last year, with interest rates on home loans doubling within the year. Homeowners who did not manage to lock in rates before the rise may be grappling with a larger monthly home loan repayment. As mortgage payments are likely to make up about a third or more of household expenses, borrowers need to keep an eye on their repayments and take steps to actively manage their mortgage. Here are 4 tips to help manage your mortgage. New homeowners will be hit by the double whammy of rising property prices and high mortgage rates. If possible, delay the purchase until rates are lower. Alternatively, consider making a bigger down payment to reduce the home loan amount. For those who are planning to buy investment properties, the recent announcement on higher ABSD would substantially increase the investment cost. If buying an HDB flat is a priority, POSB is supporting home buyers and existing HDB owners earning less than S$2,500 per month with an exclusive HDB home loan rate package at 2.60% p.a. This rate is the same as the HDB home loan rate. To help finance your monthly mortgage payment, consider utilising your CPF OA savings temporarily instead of cash, if you are in a tight cashflow situation. Once your financial health improves, consider switching back to using cash to fund your instalments, unless your investments can generate returns in excess of the risk-free 2.5% pa return from CPF OA. At all times, ensure that your OA savings can provide a buffer of monthly mortgage loan instalments for at least 12 months, in case of you lose your job. If your current home loan is out of the lock-in period, look out for refinancing/repricing opportunities that can offer you a better rate than what you are paying for. If you have a large amount of idle cash, consider making partial repayments to your mortgage. Look for accounts/products that give you a better overall deal in your banking relationships. For instance, you stand to earn higher interest with the DBS Multiplier account if you credit your salary, have a home loan, and invest with DBS. Similarly, you stand to receive up to S$700 cash bonus when you save with POSB Save As You Earn (SAYE) account, take up a POSB home loan, and protect yourself by taking up a mortgage insurance plan with us. 5. Gig workers to step up in financial planning Our report has found that gig workers are the most financially stretched, with an expense-to-income ratio of 112% in May 2023. In addition, the gig workers’ savings of just 1.7 months of expenses are way below our recommended 12 months for those with unstable income streams, and under the lower end of the recommended 3 to 6 months range for other customers. Faced with the uncertain economic climate that may increase the volatility of their income, gig workers would need to work harder to ensure that their financial cushion can support them through tough times. For instance, gig workers should aim to set aside at least 12 months’ worth of monthly expenses as savings. Come 2024, CPF contributions will be mandatory for younger gig workers aged 30 and below, while older workers will be given the choice to opt in. But why wait till then? All gig workers should consider contributing to their CPF, so that they can leverage the attractive interest in the long term. Gig workers are encouraged to optimise their CPF savings by transferring their Ordinary Account (OA) savings to the Special Account (SA) to earn higher interest rates of up to 5% pa. When doing so, adopt a long-term view as such transfers are irreversible. Other avenues include investing your OA savings wisely, and performing cash top-ups to the SA to reap the power of compounding over time. Platform workers may be more susceptible to injuries during work. Check that the company provides insurance that covers accidents and injuries while working. If not, consider some coverage that can provide financial relief during times when they are unable to work. This includes hospitalisation, critical illness, and personal accident plans. If you have a limited budget, DBS has an insurance starter plan ProtectFirst that helps young Singaporeans kickstart their protection journey affordably at a lower premium. It offers varied coverage for critical illnesses (including early stage), life protection and serious accidents. Do review your protection needs regularly in view of changing lifestyle and life-stage needs to ensure adequate coverage. 6. Start planning early Make time your ally by planning early for your financial well-being to take advantage of the longer runway for savings and investments to grow and compound. A key aspect is optimising the CPF nest egg, especially for the vulnerable groups who have limited savings. Your CPF feature in DBS digibanking app gives users a clearer picture of their future CPF savings against the projected CPF Retirement Sums for their age cohort. Coupled with your personalised consolidated financial information from SGFinDex (banks, insurers, CPF, HDB, IRAS, CDP), the Your CPF tool can harness the information and show whether you are on track. It will also offer customised insights for you to take the necessary steps to close the money gaps. If you are not on track to meet your financial goals, you can make better informed decisions such as getting a smaller home, boosting income, and reducing unnecessary spend. Use the “Plan” tab in DBS digibank to set up a customised robust and comprehensive financial plan. Boosting Health of Household Balancesheet Ready to start?

      "Pros & cons of tapping ChatGPT for financial advice By Lorna Tan  If you’ve only got a minute:  With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) engines like ChatGPT, we can enjoy quick access to information, be more productive in research work and certain tasks like preparing presentation slides, writing speeches, essays, coding, and even have philosophical conversations. Some may wonder about tapping the tool for financial advice or even as a guide for investment decisions. But does it work, and what are the risks? Before going further, we need to understand how ChatGPT works, what its primary information sources are, and the pros and cons of using it for financial purposes. How ChatGPT works In a nutshell, ChatGPT is an AI chatbot that combines its chatbot functionality “Chat”, and \"GPT\", which stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer, a model that employs natural language so that the everyday user can use the technology. Pose a question on ChatGPT and you will receive responses instantly. Do note that as these responses are based on past data, the AI models are only as good as the input data that is available to them. So, if the data is limited, incomplete, biased, or inaccurate, they will affect the quality of responses. How the questions are being asked is another factor. For instance, if the context of your query is here but you omit to mention Singapore, then the response would exclude local schemes and you may find the US retirement savings plan 401(k) as a recommended solution instead of the Central Provident Fund (CPF). As such, I would use ChatGPT as a resource for gathering information, but the content needs to be cross-checked. When required, do seek professional help too. To find out the pros and cons, here are the financial areas that I experimented on with ChatGPT. 1. Buying a home Pros: ChatGPT gave several tips towards planning and buying a home. They included creating a budget, setting up an emergency fund, and saving regularly. It also included tips on exploring CPF “to maximise benefits” (but it failed to explain what they are), understanding home loans and encouraged users to familiarise themselves with government grants to reduce financial burden. ChatGPT also included a tip on investing to grow wealth over time via stocks, bonds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and real estate investment trusts. Cons: While the tips include a few local schemes, they lack specifics like explaining the steps to optimise relevant CPF schemes, the values of the various housing grants, and how to work the savings harder before they are used for the home purchase. For example, it failed to advise individuals planning to buy a property in less than 2 years to consider investing in low-risk cash alternatives like Treasury bills (T-bills), money market funds and a high-yield savings account, to earn some interest while saving for the downpayment. This is because you might miss out on buying your house if you invest too aggressively or if your money is not liquid when you need it. If your timeframe to buy your home is 5 or more years, investing in a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds could be an option. ChatGPT’s response also lacked offering ideas on prioritising key criteria for home selection such as location, amenities, proximity to public transport, age of property and so on, to ensure a realistic budget. Also missing is advice on the use of smart tools like home affordability calculators/home loan calculators to help you with budgeting. For instance, the DBS MyHome Planning Tools can help work out a customised property budget, create cashflow timeline and calculate monthly loan repayments. Read more: To buy HDB or Condo?\n",
      "Find out more about: DBS Property Marketplace  2. Investment ideas Pros: ChatGPT suggested several areas such as real estate, technology and innovation, education and skills development, sustainable energy and green technology, ETFs, and unit trusts, and provided basic information about each asset class. Cons: While ChatGPT included a reminder that investment decisions depend on factors such as risk tolerance, goals, and time horizon, it neglected to add the things to take note of before investing, like having adequate emergency savings and having a positive cashflow. It also failed to highlight the benefits of time in the market instead of timing the market. Young adults particularly have the advantage of time on their side so they should empower themselves to embark on investing early to reap the benefits of compounding. Furthermore, there was no mention of the investing avenues like the use of digital tools, regular savings plans, robo-advisory platforms and different approaches like barbell, core-satellite, value and growth strategies.

      "Find out more about: Investing in unit trusts with DBS 3. Cryptocurrency Pros: ChatGPT was able to provide a basic guide to understanding cryptocurrency, blockchain and named the main cryptos as Bitcoin and altcoins (Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin). It gave basic information on storing cryptocurrencies in digital wallets, buying cryptocurrency, highlighted basic security measures, explained long-term trading versus trading of cryptos and encouraged users to stay up to date with crypto news and to diversify their crypto portfolio to reduce risk. Read more: Beginner’s guide to cryptocurrency\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons: ChatGPT failed to point out that cryptocurrencies are not regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore as they are not legal tender. This means that there will not be any legislative protection should anyone lose money from dealing with digital tokens. It neglected to provide information on how Bitcoin prices have been volatile and advise that investors should not be investing in cryptos if they need the money in the short term. For more holistic advice, investors should focus on their core investment portfolio using traditional asset classes like equities and bonds. They should only invest in alternative investments like cryptos only if they still have spare cash and understand the risks. It also did not give sufficient explanation on what is needed to set up an account on a crypto exchange in Singapore, and the factors (financial standing, account segregation, secure storage) to consider. For example, DBS uses 100% air-gapped cold storage technology which reduces the risk of loss of cryptocurrencies to hacks, and stores all crypto holdings in segregated accounts, which helps to ringfence the holdings should the exchange becomes insolvent. Read more: Storing cryptocurrency safely  Using AI tools for financial advice In short, one thing to note is that ChatGPT’s financial advice is typically generic, limited in the application of local schemes and not comprehensive. When it comes to financial planning, there is no “one size fits all” solution and cookie cutter advice are not applicable to everyone. This is because we have our own financial situation, life goals, and risk profile. A pitfall of being solely reliant on ChatGPT is its inability to offer customised or personalised financial advice. Financial experts are of the view that an AI tool like ChatGPT is not designed to provide financial advice but it can certainly support learning. Furthermore, the human element is extremely important in the financial services industry. ChatGPT cannot replace professional financial advisors who can do a proper fact find, ask the right questions, and recommend suitable solutions aligned to one’s circumstances and risk profile. Having said that, the financial services industry is at the forefront of technology and banks like DBS have seized the opportunity for the traditional way of seeking advice (through qualified financial advisors) and AI to work together to meet the needs of consumers. The application of AI has helped financial advisory service providers to be more efficient throughout the value chain from advisory to portfolio building, tracking, and execution for consumers. For example, the financial planning tool in DBS’ digibank can offer tailored advice that is aligned with the individual behaviour. Broadly speaking, AI can be viewed as a tool that helps both consumers and financial advisors to better identify hidden money or investment gaps. But until its functionality, accuracy and depth improve, using ChatGPT can be beneficial, but it should not be an end all. Ready to start?

      "How to get started on financial planning  If you’ve only got a minute:  Think about your current life situation. What are some changes you’re likely to expect within the next 2 years? Perhaps acquiring a new laptop or a bedroom makeover? What about in 5 years’ time? Can you envision achieving more significant milestones, such as buying your dream home or having a wedding complete with a honeymoon at your desired destination? Years from now, you could  be supporting your child through university and/or building your retirement nest. All the above are examples of your potential financial goals for the short, medium and long term. Financial planning is a personal journey since individuals have different financial goals and varying needs. That said, it doesn’t have to be complicated. With proper planning, everything will fall into place. Here are 7 tips to get you started on your financial planning journey!  1. Map out your financial journey When was the last time you had a good look at your finances? If you haven’t, it’s never too late to start. Supercharged by SGFinDex, DBS digibank takes in all your financial information from CPF, CDP, HDB, IRAS and other banks to give you a holistic view of your financial health. It also empowers you with personalised insights and tips, allowing you to make better, informed financial decisions. Hit the “Plan” tab in the app to get started. Read more: Plan on digibank - Supercharged by SGFinDex If you need help or want a second opinion, you may reach out to our team of Wealth Planning Managers (WPMs). They’ll be able to offer you advice aligned with your financial goals and circumstances.  2. Saving is the foundation After setting your financial goals, focus on building savings as a discipline. As Warren Buffet once said, “spend what is left after savings”. It is prudent to adopt the “pay yourself first” approach to automatically channel a portion of your pay to a separate account once you receive your pay cheque, before you start spending. Depending on your goals and lifestyle needs, you should try to save at least 10% of your income and this savings ratio should be one that you are comfortable with. More importantly, it is essential is to set aside savings for a rainy day. In the event of an emergency, you should have access to ready cash. It is recommended to have an emergency fund to cover at least 3 to 6 months of expenses or more if you have dependents. If you are self-employed, you may want to increase this emergency fund to cover at least 12 months of expenses. Your emergency fund does not need to stay idle. DBS’s latest report “Are you losing the race against inflation?” showed that inflation is at an all-time high and that income growth is lagging for 40% of our 1.2 million retail customers. It is important to save smarter. Customers categorised by income growth over the past year  You can grow your savings with the DBS Multiplier and enjoy an interest rate of up to 4.1% p.a. You can also stash your funds in other liquid assets including saving deposits, fixed deposits, Singapore Savings Bonds that can be readily liquidated without incurring penalties or a loss in value. Read more: Financial tips for 2023  3. Keep tabs on where your money is going Budgeting involves tracking your cashflows and making plans on ways to spend your money. While it may appear daunting for some, a simple way to start is by dissecting your expenses to gain clearer distinctions between your essential needs and discretionary wants. Our 2022 report indicated that customers are now generally spending more relative to their income. Specifically, expenses grew 2 times faster than income on aggregate. Expenses to income (%) of an average customer in May 2021 vs May 2022  Tracking your expenses makes it easier for you to re-prioritise your spending and cut down on “wants” such as fine dining and recurring expenses incurred by telco bills, gym membership, beauty and spa packages. Read more: Track  your savings and spending with digibank 4. Protect your future While it is common to safeguard ourselves and loved ones from unforeseen circumstances, many postpone or avoid addressing insurance matters due to the uncomfortable nature of discussing topics dealing with injury, illness, accidents, disasters, and death. However, a comprehensive financial plan should address protection needs because insurance serves as a safety net for you and your loved ones and it provides a sense of security should something unexpected happen. With the abundance of insurance plans available, it can be overwhelming to narrow down your options. This article can help you get started on your insurance planning and decide which policy is suitable for you. Should you require further assistance, our dedicated team of WPMs are ready to assist you in  identifying and bridging any gaps between your current and desired level of coverage. 5. Manage your debt From personal to housing loans, most of us will come face-to-face with debt at some point. As such, managing debt is the cornerstone of prudent financial planning. When taking up a home loan, it is essential to explore options that align with your needs and requirement. If you have an existing home loan, you may be able to reduce it through refinancing. Home loan options include fixed-rate, floating-rate or a combination of both. By carefully selecting the most suitable package, you can make significant savings in the long run. If you are struggling with debts, there are solutions to help you work your way out of the endless bills cycle. Rather than having debts with multiple banks, the DBS Debt Consolidation Plan can help you consolidate all your debts under one bank, providing a more steamlined approach to repay your debts and help you regain control of your financial situation. Furthermore,  you can potentially save on interest payments too. Read more: Debt repayment programmes in Singapore  6. Make your money work hard for you If you want to succeed in this financial planning journey, you can’t be working hard alone. Your money should also work diligently for you through investments. Furthermore, investing serves as a defence against inflation. It is advisable to allocate any surplus funds towards investments for higher potential gains after having addressed your savings and insurance requirements. Starting your investment journey early holds greater potential for wealth accumulation due to the effects of compounding and the capacity to ride out market volatility over time. Investing is especially important during periods of high inflation due to the accelerated decline in the value of money. Relying solely on cash deposits in bank accounts that generate a modest deposit interest rate of 1-2% is insufficient as inflation rate tends to outpace the returns earned on bank deposits, leading to negative real returns on your cash. Any surplus cash left uninvested faces the risk of a more rapid decline in its value. Real value of money under 3 scenarios  You don’t need a large capital to start investing. For beginners, kickstart your investment journey with Invest-Saver, a regular saving plan with as little as $100 a month. Alternatively, you can leave it to the DBS Investment Team of experts by investing in managed portfolios via our robo-advisory platform - digiPortfolio. Start with just $1,000 for the Asian portfolio or US$1,000 for the global portfolio. If you’re a seasoned investor and prefer to manage and build your stocks portfolio on your own, consider opening a DBS Vickers account. It provides access to 7 key global markets. Fight inertia and start checking off some items right now to be on your way towards building a robust financial plan. Read more: I’m ready to invest, how can I start? 7. Stress test your finances Most financial plans assume an inflation rate of 3% when projecting future income flows to determine retirement adequacy. Plan for higher costs of living by assuming different inflation scenarios of 3%, 4% or 5 % and work out how these different rates may impact your future cash flows and retirement planning, via the Map Your Money feature under the “Plan” tab in digibank app.  Read more: Let's get better at money All in all Financial planning can help you achieve your life goals and protect your loved ones in times of need.

      "Coping with retrenchment – 7 financial tips By Lorna Tan  If you’ve only got a minute:  Driven by business restructuring, retrenchments in Singapore more than doubled to 2,990 in 4Q2022 from the preceding quarter (1,300). And the job cuts have continued into this year. In total, there were 6,440 retrenchments in 2022. This is also seen worldwide. Besides Facebook parent Meta, which retrenched 11,000 employees worldwide, other big tech firms – such as Twitter, Microsoft, Google, Lenovo, Sea and Carousell – have done the same. Retrenchment is a form of dismissal from your job but likely through no fault of yours. It happens when firms need to reduce head count due to reorganisation, redundancy, cost reduction, or industry changes. While most people are often caught off guard when they are retrenched, more people are realising that it is a possibility that can happen to anyone, and not just to mature workers above a certain age. Being financially and mentally resilient will enable you to be better prepared for such curveballs that threaten to derail our financial plan and life goals. For instance, having sufficient emergency cash of at least 3 to 6 months of expenses will come in handy during rainy days and avoid the undesirable scenario of having to sell off insurance policies and/or investments at the wrong price and time, just to raise cash.  Here are 7 tips to help you cope with retrenchment. 1. Understand your retrenchment benefits and other payments If you're facing retrenchment, clarify on the amounts that you will be paid to help in your planning. Remember to get everything in writing before you leave the firm. The Ministry of Manpower advises companies that carry out retrenchment to pay all salaries, including unused annual leave and notice pay to their employees on their last day of work. The payments should also include benefits such as overtime, commissions, and reimbursements for expenses agreed during employment. Employees who have served the firm for at least 2 years are eligible for retrenchment benefit. Those with less than 2 years’ service could be granted an ex-gratia payment out of goodwill. The prevailing norm is to pay a retrenchment benefit of between 2 weeks and 1 month salary per year of service, depending on the firm’s financial position and the industry. In addition, firms are encouraged to help affected employees look for alternative jobs in associate companies, other companies or through outplacement assistance programmes, such as job fairs, career fairs, and career advice.  2. Review your budget with family Review your budget especially your spend categories and consider how you can reduce unnecessary expenses. Discuss your financial situation with your family members so they are aware of the need to make some sacrifices till you land another job. For example, they may need to cut down certain wants like fine dining and holidays, and have a tighter rein on their own spending. 3. Consolidate your debt Review your liabilities such as outstanding credit card debts, personal loans and mortgage. You can contact your creditors to inform them of your financial situation and if the need arises, to restructure your debt repayments before they spiral out of control. One way to do this is via a debt management programme. For instance, the Debt Consolidation Plan – offered by banks in Singapore – helps to combine your unsecured debts into one and at a reduced monthly payment. It may be less stressful to deal with one main lender instead of having multiple debts with multiple financial institutions. If you really need to take a loan, consider the duration and costs including the effective interest rate, and penalty for late payment and/or early redemption. Avoid high interest loans like credit cards unless you are confident of paying the balance in full and before the due date.  4. Review your goals Being retrenched can be highly emotional and frustrating. Tell yourself that it is not your fault. The sooner you can get over the emotional distress, the sooner you can pivot towards the new possibilities that await you. There are 2 organisations – Workforce Singapore (WSG) and e2i (Employment and Employability Institute) – that offer retrenchment counselling services as well as programmes for skills upgrading and job-matching. Take this period of unemployment as a time to reflect on your career and life goals. Stay positive on what is to come and evaluate what you would like to achieve in your work life and identify the skills required. Doing so will provide more clarity on your next steps. 5. Check if you have retrenchment or unemployment insurance Check if you might have a life insurance plan that comes with an unemployment benefit that can kick in when you are unemployed. For example, such a benefit may provide a fixed cash payout for every month of unemployment. You may receive this payout for up to 3 months to tide you over the crucial job-search period without tapping into your savings. Even if you do not have such a plan and are facing problems with insurance payments due to tight cashflows, you can discuss with your insurers on how to defer premiums through “premium holidays”, which means delaying your premiums till a later date. Other avenues include taking a loan from your insurance plan to raise cash or reducing your plan’s sum assured to cut down on premiums. 6. Look out for new opportunities Update your CV with any new skills, courses attended, and experiences. And reach out to recruiters and relevant social platforms. Remember to update your LinkedIn profile too, as it is a good vehicle for job searches and link ups to potential employers.  This may be a good time to venture into a different industry. Make a list of your qualifications and skills and check on the courses you need to make the switch. Besides looking for a full-time job, explore opportunities in the gig economy. Doing so can help to generate some income to tide things over while giving rise to other opportunities. 7. Be financially prepared The more sustainable solution for any unforeseen circumstances like retrenchment, is to be financially prepared at all times. Besides ensuring adequate emergency cash and insurance, invest your surplus cash to make it work harder for you. Time is money so adopt a long-term investing approach to reap the benefits of compounding. Start growing your nest egg early and build passive income streams so that you can be better prepared to retire, semi-retire, or take your time to look for the next opportunity, should you lose your job. If you know you are at risk of being retrenched, bump up your emergency cash to at least 12 months of expenses, to tide over the rainy day. When it comes to big-ticket item purchases like a home, consider your affordability carefully. It is also prudent especially during a high interest rate environment to set aside a buffer of CPF savings that can fund one to two years of mortgage instalments, in the event of retrenchment.

      "8 financial tips for young adults By Lorna Tan  If you’ve only got a minute:  Planning for a secure financial future may seem daunting and something distant for some young adults. They prefer to do this later because they are too caught up with their daily lives or believe that they need to have a substantial pot of savings before planning. As the new year begins and in the light of a high inflationary environment and economic uncertainties, it is an opportune time for everyone especially young adults to spring clean their finances, take note of what has been done and set up a robust plan. After all, starting early means you have more time to grow your savings, seek opportunities to make them work harder and reap the benefits from compounding over time. Here are 8 financial tips for young adults. 1. Pay yourself first This long-held habit has helped me to save diligently over the years, which then becomes the much needed “ammunition” for investing. How does it work? Automatically deduct a portion of your income each month as savings, before you spend what is left. With internet banking and digital tools these days, you can do this hassle-free and monitor your cash flows. If you have not started saving, start by socking away at least 10% of your income. It is also prudent to set aside three to six months of expenses as emergency cash for the rainy day. Our experience of living within the constraints of social distancing due to the Covid-19 pandemic has taught us that it is possible to reduce discretionary spend when the need arises. Continue to inculcate a thrifty habit and learn to defer gratification for bigger future financial rewards. Make use of digital tools like the DBS NAV Planner to keep track of your expenses and set up a realistic budget that includes saving and spending targets. A recent DBS report on the impact of inflation on financial wellness has indicated that transportation, food, and housing & utilities are the 3 key components hitting our wallets. So, it really helps to understand our individual spend habits and limit any urge to “revenge” spend. By doing so, we know which areas we can work on to reduce discretionary spend and enhance our financial situation to manage the uncertainties ahead.   \n",
      "2. Set life goals Our life goals evolve as our circumstances change. While spring-cleaning our finances, adopt a “helicopter” view. Besides taking stock of your current situation, include your mid and long-term goals. This will crystalise the money gaps that you need to close to achieve financial wellness and your goals. Ask yourself if you need to reduce your expenses and/or look for a side hustle to increase total income. Once you have set your goals, work out the steps to help you achieve them. Repeat this exercise at least once a year.   3. Shop wisely Shop around and compare products and services before making an informed purchase. Consider buying house brand products at supermarkets, bulk buy non-perishables if there is significant discount, and look out for suitable second-hand items and promos. Another tip is to use credit/debit cards that are more suited to your lifestyle and spending patterns to earn cashback, points, and miles. Do ensure control over your spending as credit card debts can snowball quickly if they are not well-managed. Pay your bills in full and on time. If you have multiple credit cards, streamline the payment date to avoid incurring late payment fees should you forget to pay on time. 4. Inflation-proof your savings While emergency cash should be kept liquid, keeping all your savings in a simple savings account will not preserve your purchasing power, especially in a high inflationary environment. Some possible instruments to consider for the more liquid and low-risk portion of a portfolio, include higher interest-yielding savings accounts like DBS Multiplier Account, Singapore Savings Bonds, Treasury Bills, and money market funds. Beyond savings, you’d need to start investing your money for a better chance at beating inflation and longevity, as well as achieving your life goals. 5. Assess protection needs For beginners, start off with considering if you need to upgrade to an Integrated Shield hospitalisation plan before moving on to explore other protection-type cover such as life insurance, critical illness, disability income, and personal accident. Even if you’re new to insurance, you’re likely to have existing insurance policies that your parents could have bought for you, term life cover from Dependants’ Protection Scheme, CPF savings and bank savings. It’s important to take them into account when working out your insurance gaps. For those who want to build insurance coverage a bit at a time, without feeling the pinch, bite-size insurance plans, such as ProtectFirst, are available at relatively lower premiums without the hassle of undergoing medical tests and need for documentation. It can be useful especially as a starting point for those who are first-time buyers or the underinsured. Such “micro-insurance” coverage helps to lower barriers of entry and can help these people meet their immediate needs and get more familiar with the product before opting for a more comprehensive plan, while building up his/her affordability. To prevent yourself from over- or under-insuring, you can check out the DBS NAV Planner to help you keep track of your insurance needs. It’ll give you personalised calculations on how much insurance you’ll need depending on your dependants, life stage and income. You’ll even get suggestions on how your insurance cover might change over time. To help you decide on a policy, here’s a checklist: 6. Start investing early Not taking any investment risk poses a risk, because your purchasing power with the same dollar shrinks with time. Start small with a regular savings plan like Invest-Saver that lets you invest in a fixed sum on your choice of ETFs or unit trusts, from S$100 monthly. You can also consider robo-advisors, such as DBS digiPortfolio, which are digital platforms that provide automated, algorithm-driven investing services in the form of curated portfolios with pre-selected instruments based on risk rating. Novice investors can rest easy as it takes the guesswork out of stock-picking to have your funds professionally managed by our wealth management experts. For seasoned investors it can be a low-cost and convenient way to complement your other investments as part of a long-term strategy. Embarking on your investment journey early would enable you to ride out market volatility and let the compounding effect work to your advantage as you have time on your side. When returns and dividends from investments are re-invested regularly, over time, the total investment portfolio value will grow substantially. Investing also helps to mitigate the effects of inflation and longevity. 7. Maximise returns on your CPF savings Retirement may seem decades away for young adults. But it is never too early to plan for financial freedom by leveraging the attractive interest rates offered by CPF savings and reap the magic of compounding. By topping up your CPF Special Account (SA) with cash, you enjoy interest of up to 5% per annum (pa) as well as enjoy tax relief of up to S$8,000 per calendar year. Do note that this applies only for cash top-ups up to the prevailing Full Retirement Sum which is S$198,800 this year. You can also transfer your Ordinary Account savings which earns at least 2.5% pa to your SA to earn the higher interest.    \n",
      "8. Empower yourself with financial literacy Learning how to manage money from an early age will help to shape positive money mindsets and habits. A financially empowered person will be able to better anticipate his future financial needs and know how to allocate his money prudently and have access to resources, tools, and professional help to make informed decisions to achieve life goals. Financial planning cannot be reduced to an investment idea. Think of those who have sunk everything into cryptos without doing research and are weathering the recent bloodbath, no thanks to the recent collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX. In fact, a holistic financial plan should include budgeting, insurance, diversified investments, home planning, retirement, and estate planning. So, equip yourself with financial knowledge by reading, attending financial-related seminars and joining discussion forums with like-minded people and financial experts. Ready to start?

      "7 financial ratios to gauge your financial health  If you’ve only got a minute:  Financial ratios form an integral part of a company’s financial statement and are often useful in guiding investors in their investment decisions. However, these ratios aren’t limited to businesses and stocks. In similar fashion, you (and I!) can utilise specific ratios to evaluate your financial health. Unlike corporate ratios, personal financial ratios are relatively easy to compute and can be used to determine your money strengths and concurrently, shed light to areas that require improvement.  Here are 7 noteworthy ratios you could use to help you identify potential financial pitfalls and make informed financial decisions for the long haul.  1. Basic liquidity ratio Also known as the emergency fund ratio, the basic liquidity ratio alerts you to whether you have adequate cash reserves to cover your monthly expenses in the event of an emergency, such as job loss (retrenchment) or unexpected expenses (urgent medical bills). It also specifies the number of months you can continue paying your expenses should you lose your income source. Monetary assets are the most liquid since they can be converted quickly to cash with no loss in value. These include your cash or cash-equivalent securities like fixed deposits and Singapore Savings Bonds (SSBs).  The ratio is derived by comparing your total cash (or cash equivalents) to your monthly expenses. The higher the number, the more liquid your assets. As a guide, it is recommended to set aside at least 3 to 6 months’ worth of expenses. If you are self-employed or have a higher number of dependants, you may want to consider increasing your liquidity ratio to 12 months instead. 2. Liquid assets to net worth ratio Your net worth is the value of your total assets (individually-owned: property, investments, cash) less all your liabilities (common debts: mortgage, car loan, personal loan, etc).   This ratio measures the percentage of your total assets that are cash (or cash equivalents). The higher the liquidity ratio, the bigger the buffer you have against any unexpected income loss. While it is good to have contingency cash for a rainy day, avoid having a high liquidity ratio as this would mean you’re keeping too much cash on hand and not enough in investments.   A good rule of thumb is to have at least 15% of your net worth in cash or assets that can be readily converted into cash to cover short-term debt obligations or other emergency situations where you might require cash quickly. 3. Savings ratio  How much of your monthly income that you channel towards savings is determined by this ratio. The higher the ratio, the better, as this reflects your ability to save more than you spend. However, do note that having too much idle cash is not prudent because we need to work our money harder to mitigate against inflation and longevity risks. You should try to save at least 10% of your income and this savings ratio should be one that you are comfortable with.  4. Debt to assets ratio  This ratio indicates how much of your assets are funded by debt and helps you understand if you have borrowed more than you should. The higher your debt ratio, the higher your liabilities and this could potentially lead to solvency issues. For example, if you have recently made a big-ticket purchase such as a house and have an ongoing mortgage, you should probably refrain from taking out another loan for a brand-new sports car as this would increase your liabilities. Unless you are certain you have not borrowed beyond your repayment capacity and can afford to pay back the loan, it is best to wait till you settle outstanding debts first.  As a guide, you should work towards a ratio of less than 50%. 5. Total debt servicing ratio (TDSR)  This ratio calculates the amount of your salary that is used for your regular debt settlements. Ideally, a ratio of 35% or below means you have ample income to fulfil your monthly debt repayments. Let’s assume John’s monthly net income is $5,000 and he services a $1,500 mortgage and $1,000 car loan repayment monthly. The remaining amount constitutes his savings, investments, and other expenditure.  2,500/5,000 x 100 = 50% It is best for John to start reducing his debts to derive a ratio of 35% or less, to ensure higher savings and less debts. He can consider reducing his monthly debts by 1) purchasing a lower-priced car (or sell his car and take public transport), 2) opt for a longer home loan tenure to increase his liquidity by refinancing or repricing. Following the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s (MAS) guideline for home loans, the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) should not exceed 55%. The mortgage servicing ratio (MSR) – applicable to HDBs and ECs, and TDSR – applicable to both public and private properties - are home loan limits implemented by MAS to prevent overleveraging. Simply put, it is to prevent people from taking up huge home loans that exceeds their affordability and to address the lack of loan restrictions previously that could have led to property speculation. 6. Net invested assets to net worth ratio This ratio lets you know how much of your assets (excluding your home) are effectively used to accumulate wealth for you for the long-term. In short, it tells you how well you’re using your money to work harder for you.  Start channelling surplus cash into investments early and adopt a long-term investment horizon. The earlier you start investing, the higher the potential of wealth accumulation, thanks to the power of compounding. Due to a longer time horizon, you’ll also be able to ride out market volatility over time. Not only can you make your money work harder for you, investing protects you from the loss of purchasing power due to inflation as well.  To position yourself well for your retirement years, strive to have at least 50% of your assets invested. 7. Solvency ratio Finally, the solvency ratio offers clarity as to whether you have sufficient assets in your portfolio to service your debts. To calculate net worth, subtract your liabilities/debts from your assets. It lets you know the probability of becoming insolvent or bankrupt.  Sometimes, we acquire assets and use debt to finance them which may result in a higher amount of debt (loan) than the value of the asset (property). An example is when you take on a mortgage loan after buying your home. The solvency ratio is calculated to gauge your risk of getting bankrupt due to the inability to settle the debts taken. As such, the higher the solvency ratio, the stronger your financial position. In Summary These 7 personal finance ratios can be used as a starting point to gauge your financial health and as a guide to enhance your finances. These ratios are in no way a substitute to a holistic financial plan.

      "Are you losing the race against inflation? By Lorna Tan  If you’ve only got a minute:  With inflation hitting record highs coupled with ballooning expenses and sluggish income growth, consumers are caught in a bind. But all is not lost as we can focus on the things that are within our control to better manage our finances and rise above the ugly head of inflation. In 2022, DBS published  “Are you losing the race against inflation?” an in-depth report that examined the impact of inflation on different consumer segments, analysed income growth, and offered tips on how to combat inflation. It highlighted that the lowest income group and baby boomers (ages 58 to 76) are among the most vulnerable to inflation. As such, these consumers could have less bandwidth to stomach higher inflation rates in the future. On a positive note, millennials (ages 26 to 41) and boomers are in a better financial position to beat inflation. This is because their investments grew faster than expenses over the past year. On the other hand, Gen X customers (ages 42 to 57), who are near retirement age but saw investment growth lagging that of expenses, could invest more to boost financial resilience and safeguard their nest egg. The report also indicated that the incomes of nearly half a million DBS customers lagged the surging inflation rate, with some customers even experiencing a decline in real income. This is exacerbated by expenses, which have grown 2 times faster than income over the past year. Impact of inflation on financial wellness This research paper is the 4th instalment in the DBS NAV Financial Health Series that analysed publicly available data as well as aggregated and anonymised data insights from 1.2 million DBS retail customers. Here are 12 key highlights.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Income is not keeping up with inflation Among the sampled customers, 40% saw their income grow by less than 5% in 2021, which is lower than Singapore’s average CPI inflation of 5.2% in first half of 2022, and DBS’ 2022 CPI forecast of 5.1%. Below is the customer split by income growth over the past year. 2. Lowest income group witnessed the greatest lag in income growth Customers within the income group earning below $2,500 registered just a 2.5% increase in income between May 2021 and May 2022. Simply put, vulnerable segments of the society are struggling most with high inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Upward income mobility amid challenging times About 23% of the customers who were earning below $2,500 in May 2021 managed to move up to higher income bands over the past year amid the economic recovery, along with the improvement in job prospects and wages. If we consider income mobility effects, then the income growth situation of this income group would appear more encouraging.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Rise in expenses Customers are now spending 64% of their income, versus 59% a year ago. The rising proportion of expenses to income in May 2022 suggests that the growth rate of expenses has outpaced that of income.    Customers are still spending within their means, although rising expense-to-income ratios suggest inflationary effects and pent-up spending over the past year. 5. Increase in expenditure has outpaced income growth by 2x Overall monthly expenses for sampled customers grew 22.2% in May 2022, compared to their income growth of 11.1%. This is even more so for the lowest income group, who saw their expenses grow 13.8%, which is 5.6x faster than their income growth of 2.5%. 6. Keep discretionary spending in check amid high inflation All expense categories saw double-digit growth over the past year. Apart from transportation (+60.2%), spending on shopping, entertainment, and travel, which are discretionary in nature, witnessed the steepest increase (+56.7%). Below is the expense growth rate by categories for an average customer. 7. 3 key drivers of inflation in Singapore Inflation affects everyone differently, depending on individual’s expenditure pattern. The 3 key drivers of inflation in Singapore have been food, transportation, and housing & utilities, which together account for around 63% of the overall CPI basket. 8. Lowest income group and Boomers at a disadvantage We observe that the lowest income group (those earning less than $2,500) spends almost the entirety of their income, with a significantly higher expense-to-income ratio of 94% in May 2022 (versus average of 64%). They are more vulnerable to high inflation, based on their lower wallet bandwidth.  Among the different generations, the expense-to-income ratio (96%) for Boomers is the highest, thus suggesting a lower bandwidth to stomach higher inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Investments experienced positive growth On an aggregate basis, total investments of customers grew 24.5%, outpacing the growth in expenses of 22.2%. However, the main laggards are Gen X customers who saw their investments grow at a slower rate than their expenses, while Millennials and Boomers generally saw their investment growth outpace that of their expenses.  There could be more room for growth in investments among Gen Xers given they are near retirement age, which makes investing and financial planning a more pressing priority.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Shift in investments toward bonds across all generations and income groups There are also signs of “flight to safety” amid recent market volatility. In May 2022 compared to a year ago, bonds make up 37% of total investments, up from 2% in the previous year.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. Digibank “Plan” tab users are more likely to invest Across all generations and income groups, 10% of customers, on average, who use the “Plan” tab within digibank app invest, versus only 3% of non-digibank “Plan” tab users that do. Furthermore, digibank “Plan” tab users were found to have more monies invested (based on asset under management or AUM), close to 3x the amount of a non-digibank “Plan” tab user.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. Don’t lose your cash to inflation by investing The value of money declines more rapidly during periods of high inflation. The rate of inflation outpaces that of the returns earned on bank deposits, translating into negative real returns on cash. Excess cash, if uninvested, is at risk of seeing its value erode during periods of high inflation. Here’s an example of real value of money under 3 scenarios.  Here is a summary of the 12 key highlights from the report. What can you do in this environment? Here are 6 tips to guard against inflation and make your finances more resilient. 1. Review your expenses regularly In today’s environment of rising prices, we are facing the reality of tightening our belts. The report has indicated that transportation, food, housing and utilities are the 3 key components hitting our wallets. So, it really helps to understand our individual spend habits. By doing so, we know which areas we can work on to reduce discretionary spend and enhance our financial situation to manage the uncertainties ahead. Consider using the digital financial advisory tool such as the “Plan” tab within digibank app  to help you keep track of your expenses and set up a budget that includes saving and spending targets. More importantly, make it a habit to review your expenses and make necessary adjustments. With interest rates heading north, those who are servicing their home loan may consider refinancing or repricing to a more suitable mortgage, if they are out of the lock-in period. Do a cost-benefit analysis first and consult a home loans specialist. Home loan options include fixed-rate, floating-rate, or a combination of both. For new home buyers, do refrain from over-leveraging and maintain adequate funds to tide through at least a year. For homeowners experiencing tight cashflows during this period, consider paying off housing loans through your CPF OA account and maintain liquidity. You can always do a voluntary housing refund to your CPF OA in the future when your situation improves. 2. Shop wisely Shopping wisely does not just mean shopping less, but instead making the most out of your necessary spending. 4 ways to do this include: This can also be done in indirect ways like using the appropriate payment cards to maximise your benefits. However, be sure to pay your bills in full and on time and to monitor your spending to avoid racking up huge debts from overspending or snowballing interest from late payments.   3. Inflation-proof your savings While emergency cash should be kept liquid, keeping all of your savings in a simple savings account will not preserve your purchasing power, especially in a high inflationary environment. Some possible instruments to consider for the more liquid and low-risk portion of a portfolio, include higher interest-yielding savings account like DBS Multiplier Account, Singapore Savings Bonds, money market funds or endowment insurance plans. Beyond savings, you’d need to start investing your money for a better chance at beating inflation and achieving your life goals. 4. Start investing and adopt a long-term horizon When it comes to investing, it is crucial to take a long-term approach and allocate a portion of your net worth towards investments. As a rule of thumb, at least 50% of your net worth (assets minus liabilities) should be invested. An example of an investment product that can help you get started is DBS Invest-Saver, a regular savings plan (RSP). DBS Invest-Saver adopts a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy by setting aside a pre-determined amount of savings for investing, each month. This allows you to accumulate your investments steadily instead of timing the market. It also reduces the impact of short-term market fluctuations on your portfolio. You can also consider ready-made investment solutions like DBS digiPortfolio, which is powered by human expertise (team of portfolio managers) and robo-technology. The range of portfolios available through DBS digiPortfolio are meticulously screened and selected by the DBS Investment team. The team also monitors the market regularly to ensure alignment with DBS Chief Investment Officer’s (CIO) views.

Stress-test your financial plan Most financial plans assume an inflation rate of 2% - 3% when projecting future income flows to determine retirement adequacy. Plan for higher costs of living by assuming different inflation scenarios of 3%, 4% or 5% and work out how these different rates impact your future cash flows and retirement planning. The Map Your Money feature under the” Plan” tab in the digibank app allows for different projections of inflation rates and investment yields, which is great for stress-testing your finances and identifying your gaps early for clarity.  6. Don’t forget about insurance! The Covid-19 pandemic has increased awareness that taking care of ourselves and attending to our health is more important than ever. It may be tempting to cancel or reduce your insurance coverage to lower monthly expenses, but the last thing you want to worry about in a health crisis/accident is how you can pay for your medical expenses. Going forward, healthcare and insurance spending will likely play a bigger role in our financial planning since inflation will increase healthcare costs as well. As a guideline, we recommend our customers to have a suitable hospitalisation plan, a basic life cover of about 9 to 10 times your annual income, as well as about 5x your annual income in critical illness cover. Note: On 1 April 2023, changes were implemented to the cancer coverage of Integrated Shield Plans (IPs). This change follows the adjustments for MediSave and MediShield Life since 1 September 2022 where only treatments that are listed on the Cancer Drug List (CDL) are covered.

      "Will Property still be your pot of gold? By Lorna Tan  If you’ve only got a minute:  It is often said that Singaporeans have a love affair with property. After all, the asset class has worked well in the past, especially for older Singaporeans, as a vehicle to accumulate wealth and as a legacy for their loved ones. This is because the value of homes and investment property has jumped by multiple folds over the years. But is this a sustainable investment approach for Singaporeans, moving forward? DBS latest report “Will Property still be your pot of gold?” highlighted that a new private property may no longer be “that pot of gold” that Singaporeans can solely rely on as their retirement nest egg. In fact, some middle-aged Singaporeans – likely those in the sandwich generation – are caught in an undesirable situation of having too much savings locked up in property with little left to invest in other asset classes that can offer superior returns and liquidity. So, what have worked in the past may no longer be enough nor cost-effective for those working towards financial freedom. This research paper is the third instalment in the DBS NAV Financial Health Series that analysed publicly available data as well as aggregated and anonymised data insights from 1.2 million DBS retail customers. Here are 5 key highlights and financial planning tips from this study. 1. Other asset classes offer higher returns and liquidity  Property market returns are no longer as attractive as before, no thanks to cooling measures. After studying the total returns of different asset classes from 1Q2009 to 1Q2021, the best performing investments were S&P500 and S-Reits, followed by property assets. More specifically, for every $100 invested, an investor will stand to receive returns of about $635 from the S&P500 Index (a stock market index in the US that tracks 500 large, listed firms) and $486 from S-Reits, versus $399 and $339, should the same amount be invested in a first private property or HDB flat instead. Buying a 2nd private property yielded the lowest growth, with a return of a mere $209 per $100 invested, which significantly falls short of the returns on equities. This is due to lower loan-to-value (LTV) ratio and higher acquisition costs such as the Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty (ABSD). For example, the total one-off costs for a second property worth $1.5 million is about $227,350 or 15% of the total price. Would you buy a stock if you knew that it would decline by more than 15% in value the next moment? Tips Rather than putting all eggs in one basket or thinking that our property is equivalent to a retirement ticket, consider growing our net worth through a diversified investment portfolio. While property may remain a core part of the portfolio, the inclusion of other asset classes – for example, equities, Reits, exchange-traded funds, bonds and alternatives, as well as CPF and SRS savings – will form a more balanced investment strategy that can go a longer way to achieve financial resilience. The right mix of assets can help to maximise the risk-reward from all investments. Take advantage of digibank to set up a holistic financial plan and close your money gaps by investing in other asset classes conveniently and cost-effectively through low-cost digital investing solutions like the robo-advisor digiPortfolio and regular savings plans. More than 2.4 million customers have planned and invested with digibank. We found that these users across most age and income groups are generally investing greater sums of capital in a year – at about $7,500 – which is more than double the amount invested by an average retail customer at $3,000. Customers who invest more actively will be better positioned to grow their net worth. 2. Specific groups of Singaporeans face challenges in housing affordability and retirement planning Housing affordability tends to be the most stretched (based on median mortgage-to-income ratios) among those with income up to $5,999/month, and in the 30-49 age group who were also found to exhibit the lowest propensity to invest. Private property owners in the 30-39 and 40-49 age groups were found to have higher mortgage-to-income ratios at an average of 0.27 (27%) (ranging between 19-46%) and 0.26 (26%) (ranging between 19-39%) respectively. These age groups are also most likely experiencing a peak in their financial commitments, given priorities such as having to care for their children and provide for their elderly parents at the same time, or upgrading to a new and bigger home. With mortgage payments typically making up the largest component of a household’s monthly recurring expense, the ability for these groups of customers to plan for their retirement is negatively impacted. Tips While financial planning is for everyone, those in the middle-age group will likely require more help since they would have multiple financial responsibilities, such as servicing mortgage loan, insurance premiums, and supporting their children and parents. In addition, they need to mitigate against risks like longevity, inflation, illnesses, job loss and prepare for their retirement. It is important to keep a pulse on short and long-term goals like financial freedom and have a comprehensive plan to navigate their journey. This includes having adequate insurance protection and a sound estate plan so that dependants can continue with their lifestyle should something untoward happen to you. Invest wisely with positive cashflows in suitable investments, build passive income streams by toping up their CPF and SRS savings and continuously upgrade their financial knowledge, to achieve sustainable financial wellness. 3. Housing affordability is a concern Income growth has generally kept pace with property price increases in the past. But in the last five years, increasing property prices have outpaced salary growth. Income growth has slowed to 1.2% (median income) and 1.7% (80th percentile). This is one of the lowest growth rates in 20 years, while property prices rose at a faster pace of 2.1%. This means that property is starting to get unaffordable. Considering a like-for-like property upgrade today, price-to-income ratios are estimated to rise to almost 15 times for the median income household, and 8.3 times for a household in the 80th income percentile. This is the highest in 20 years. This means current prices are not sustainable unless we start to see salaries increase at a faster rate. Historically, the ratio has been about 10 times for the median income household. DBS data showed that there is evidence of stretched affordability ratios in recent years, with upgraders buying smaller homes (homes sizes have declined 20% since 2010), while paying higher prices on a per square foot (psf) basis (average psf jumped by 50% since 2010). Given work-from-home arrangements necessitated by the Covid-19 pandemic, there may be a shift in preference towards bigger homes This will further stretch affordability and implies that households will increasingly need to be dual income, to achieve greater financial flexibility. Tips Affordability is key when it comes to purchasing a big-ticket item like property – do your sums carefully to see if you will be able to commit to the mortgage payments over time before making your purchase. Do note that a 20% drop in income will drive mortgage servicing ratios up by 5-9%, which will cause significant financial stress on households. 4. Slower rate of property price increase in recent years  Note: Investment returns are based on a time horizon of 1Q2009 to 1Q2021.\n",
      "Source: Bloomberg L.P., DBS Bank In the recent decade, property price growth has been modest. The Singapore property market had a compound annual growth rate of 5.9% between 1991-2011, before slowing to 1.1% in 2011-2021. More specifically, in 1991- 2001, private property prices rose 6.8-7.7% and HDB resale by 11.1%, before slowing to a mere 1.0-1.2% and 0.9%, respectively, between 2011-2021. For the earlier generation of Singaporeans, especially the baby boomers (defined as those born between 1946-1964), it is no surprise that property was a major contributor to household wealth over time. While there has been a recent upswing in buyer sentiment – driven by upgraders, DBS remains watchful of the pace of increase in the private property price index (PPI) and HDB resale index, both of which rose approximately 7% and 11% respectively over the past year, despite the pandemic and the government’s continued hawkish stance on the property market. 5. Impact of changing demographics and overall demand for homes The changing demographics amid an ageing population and tighter manpower policies may result in a lower demand for property in the future and make it challenging to find tenants. And do keep in mind that the authorities might implement more cooling measures if property prices continue to climb. Ready to start? Check out digibank to analyse your real-time financial health.

      "Financial Planning for women at different life stages By Lynette Tan If you’ve only got a minute:  It is of paramount importance that women understand why they need to plan. Given that females have an average lifespan of 86 years (about 5 years longer than males), they’re likely to live longer. This underlines the need to plan for the long-term. Having a comprehensive financial plan takes a lot of the uncertainty out of ageing. For this year’s International Women’s day, why not practise some self-care and review your finances to see how you can improve on your financial well-being? A man is not a financial plan Women should recognise that they have a personal responsibility to start planning early. By doing so, they’ll be better equipped to upgrade their financial know how and manage their money matters well. As their life evolve, their financial goals and needs will change over time. So should their financial plan. Here are three major life stages and the likely financial planning priorities: 1. Entering the workforce Women should aim to adopt a disciplined savings strategy and set aside an emergency fund that can sustain three to six months of expenses. You can start by saving at least 10% of your income every month. This will help protect you from financial uncertainties arising from a job loss or medical crisis.  Get basic life and health insurance and be adequately insured while the premiums are low, and you are still insurable and healthy. Review your family’s medical history and consider buying appropriate health insurance (for example, female-related critical illnesses) to mitigate the risk of being diagnosed with similar illnesses. If you have dependants, consider getting term insurance to protect them in the event of premature death or if you become totally and permanently disabled.  Consider investing some of your savings on a regular basis to benefit from the power of compounding and make time your best friend to ride out market volatility. If you are unsure of what to invest and prefer to DIY, use the services of a robo-advisory platform (such as DBS digiPortfolio) for easy access to professionally managed portfolios that are aligned to your risk profile. 2. Mid-career  A home is a big-ticket item so buy one that you can afford and leave more to invest based on your risk profile, to build passive income flows to fund your golden years. Understand that there are trade-offs between short- and long-term goals. For example, buying branded goods or taking up a car loan may impact your future financial wellness. You may be married now and have become a mother. With increased commitments, ensure that you and your loved ones have adequate insurance coverage. If you have children and are also responsible for your parents, ensure you have planned for the kids’ tertiary education as well as your parents’ long-term care. If you are single, you may desire to help fund the educational needs of your siblings and help plan for the retirement needs of your parents. If you have children and are also responsible for your parents, ensure you have planned for the kids’ tertiary education as well as your parents’ long-term care. If you are single, you may desire to help fund the educational needs of your siblings and help plan for the retirement needs of your parents. 3. Preparing for retirement Having a comprehensive financial plan is necessary to mitigate the risks of inflation, longevity and healthcare costs. As you journey through life, continually review the income flows that will fund your desired retirement lifestyle and duration and close the gaps with a digital financial tool like the DBS Plan & Invest tab in digibank. Do consider topping up your own CPF as well as your loved one’s CPF accounts to enjoy the risk-free interest on your savings. In doing so, you get to enjoy tax savings as well. Consider investing your CPF and SRS savings in suitable products. Aim to fully pay up the housing loan of your residence before you retire. As you plan for retirement, you would also want to think about how you can optimise your home as an asset. For instance, if your children are no longer staying with you, you can consider downgrading to a smaller place to unlock more cash. If you are short on cash, consider monetising your home via renting, downsizing, lease buyback, or a home equity income loan. A portion of your savings can also be used to buy a retirement income plan to complement the national annuity CPF LIFE payouts during your retirement. In recent years, these retirement income insurance plans have become increasingly popular among Singaporeans. For instance, RetireSavvy, Singapore’s first flexible digital retirement product allows customers to adjust their plan whenever they want, to help them easily manage any changes later in life. The premium is a manageable $128.74 a month, based on a 30-year-old individual and a 10-year premium payment term. The plan comes with a flexibility to top-up their premium any time after the first year, up until five years before their selected retirement age. They can also set their desired retirement age during the policy term and choose when to start receiving their retirement benefits. For example, they can retire at 70 instead of 55, and receive 20% of their benefits and get the remaining 80% as their monthly retirement income. With these customisable options, saving for retirement can be a priority, whether you’re climbing the corporate ladder or just a little unsure of what the future holds. You can also consider investing in the Retirement Portfolio via our digiportfolio. It is a single investment solution which employs a ‘glidepath’ strategy. When you are further out from retirement, the portfolio allocation is geared towards higher risk assets such as equities to help you accumulate and grow your wealth over years to retirement. The longer time horizon to retirement would also allow for your portfolio to ride out ups and downs of markets. Over the years and as you move closer to retirement, risk is gradually dialled back by reducing allocation in higher risk assets and increasing allocation to fixed income funds, building a more conservative and stable portfolio to ease into your retirement years. Lastly, many neglect the need to set up a sound estate plan. It is important – whether you are single or married - so that your last wishes will be carried out efficiently such that there is sufficient capital for your dependants to be well take care of even when you are no longer around. Common Financial Pitfalls for Women 1. Lack of medical insurance coverage Women are more prone to certain medical conditions like musculoskeletal problems and some critical illnesses such as breast/cervical cancers and/or pregnancy complications. Be prepared for the unexpected by having adequate insurance cover, especially for hospitalisation and critical illness. For single women, consider sufficient long-term care cover as well. This is because they are far less likely to have a partner to care for them in old age. 2. Potential pitfalls of credit card usage Owning a credit card can be exciting for those who have just started working. However, in their haste to use their plastic to pay for groceries, online shopping, transport, and that branded handbag to chalk up cash rebates, reward points and air miles, some females are unaware that missing a payment or just forking out the minimum payment each month may snowball into a bigger debt. All is fine if they can pay their credit card bills in full and on time each month. However, they are on a slippery slope if they allow their bills to go unpaid over time as the credit card interest rates and payments will spike. To repay their credit card loan, some may be forced to take a loan which can derail their retirement plan. 3. Having no “Plan B” Some women may prefer to be a Stay-At-Home-Mum (SAHM) after they give birth as this is a precious period which they may wish to spend with their child. For many SAHM, they may quit their jobs and rely entirely on their husband’s income. While this is up to personal choice, women should always have a plan B if things do not work out.  For instance, relying on a single income at home puts the entire family at financial risk should the husband get retrenched or meet with a medical crisis. As such, it is best that there is a source of recurring or passive income for the woman to at least sustain her minimum living requirements. There are several ways to earn passive income, including investing or taking up a side hustle. One should also try to remain relevant in the society by upgrading themselves, should they hope to return to work after a few years. Taking a career break can result in reduced opportunities for career advancement and lower lifetime earnings compared with their male counterparts. Thus, proper financial planning is critical to ensure they do not outlive their nest egg. While it may be taboo to think about the possibility of divorce happening, the financial consequences are undesirable, on top of the emotional upheaval and changes to your life. Arming yourself with the knowledge of how a divorce can impact you financially can help you make the right decisions to hopefully reduce the emotional and financial pain for everyone. To sum up, empower yourself by taking charge of your financial wellness with early planning and taking the appropriate actions to safeguard yourself and your loved ones! Ready to start?

      "5 everyday tips on saving money  If you’ve only got a minute:  Thinking about money can be stressful, no matter your age or life-stage. A DBS report, “Are you losing the race against inflation”, highlighted that high inflation is chipping away at income growth, eroding the value of money and consumers’ purchasing power. With prices of everyday necessities heading north, tips on saving money can help Singaporeans manage their budget better. Here are 5 practical ways to help you save on everyday essentials to make room for little indulgences, so you can create space for the things and people that matter.  1. Track your expenses & budget with an app like Plan & Invest tab in digibank The number one tip for saving money is to understand your spending patterns. Our research showed that customers spent more in 2022 than in 2021. Expenses to Income (%) for an average customer in May 2021 vs May 2022  Note: Expenses include the following categories: Housing, food, transportation, healthcare, insurance, education, shopping, travel and entertainment, as well as other expenses, i.e. 'Others'. 'Others' include Giro. point of sale/Nets payments, service charge, cash top-ups, cas line payments, hire pruchase, rental, repair and more.\n",
      "Source: DBS Bank Of course, there are commitments that we cannot step away from completely, such as loan repayments, parents’ allowances, pocket money for the kids’, and bills. But once we start taking notes, you might be surprised at where your money goes without you realising. Whether it’s your coffee or bubble tea habit, your 3pm afternoon snack, taxi / rideshare bookings, or an outsized grocery bill, a good budgeting app will be able to highlight these expenditures for you. The ”Plan and Invest” tab in the digibank app, along with other features, shows you how much you’re spending in various categories (and more!). Find out where your money goes with DBS digibank. Once you start tracking your expenses, you can identify your spending patterns and reduce expenditure on certain categories such as food or transport. Set achievable and realistic goals in order to effortlessly introduce lifestyle changes without depriving yourself. For instance, instead of cutting out coffee entirely, consider replacing it with a kopi from the coffee shop or food court? Or perhaps, reduce the number of taxis and rideshares monthly and opt for public transport instead?  Remember, a little goes a long way and it’s never too late to make small changes every now and then!  2. Use apps that offer discounts on groceries, dine-in and food delivery It’s not always possible to get cheap groceries in Singapore, especially if you have a preference for certain brands. For non-perishable items, it may be cheaper to make bulk purchases during sales to enjoy greater savings. However, ensure you have ample storage space for your items before making bulk purchases to avoid cluttering in your home. You may also want to do some research on the types of cards that gives you the best cash rebates and rewards where you do your grocery shopping. Learn more about cash rebates on grocery purchases If you dine out often, look out for credit cards and meal deals on sites such as Burpple, Chope and Fave. Planning ahead means you can grab a friend to take advantage of one-for-one deals, or purchase discount vouchers in advance. You can also check DBS PayLah! mobile app for deals near you. You’ll find dining deals to save money on food delivery, which works fabulously for those days where you’d rather enjoy your favourite dishes without leaving home. More importantly, you can offset your bills with DBS Points or POSB Daily$ instantly. Afterall, it’s the ultimate everyday app that allows you to book rides, order meals, buy tickets and more! Check out Daily deals on DBS PayLah!  3. Go green for electricity savings It is important to find out your electricity consumption, especially with the current hybrid working arrangements (you may be spending more time at home). Are you switching off plugs when they’re not in use? Are you using electrical appliances that are energy-efficient with better energy ratings? Do you use cooler and energy-saving LED lights, or turn off lights when they’re not in use? Do you keep your air-conditioning at 25°C – or better still, use the fan? Not only are these simple actions you can take to reduce your utility bills, they’re also good for the environment. Tip: DBS Home & Living Marketplace features a comparison tool for you to compare electricity plans from various providers so that you can pick one that best fit your lifestyle and budget. Enjoy bill rebates and save more when you switch with our electricity providers. Paying with the POSB Everyday Card entitles you to even more cash rebates. Stretch your household budget with DBS Home & Living Marketplace  4. Grow your money with high interest savings accounts Saving money is not just about tightening your belt, it also involves making your money work harder. In today’s inflationary environment, it is crucial to safeguard your money from losing its value. While emergency cash should be kept liquid, keeping the rest of your savings in a simple savings account will not preserve your purchasing power. Instead of letting your money sit idly in a basic savings account, consider getting a higher-interest savings account, such as the DBS Multiplier. Enjoy interest rates of up to 4.1% p.a. (up to $100,000), with no minimum amount required on transactions across your DBS/POSB products. Other possible instruments to consider include Singapore Savings Bonds, endowment plans or money market funds. Beyond savings, start investing for a chance to beat inflation. Learn how Multiplying is easier for everyone now  5. Top up your CPF and SRS accounts for more tax reliefs When you make cash top-ups to your own or your loved ones’ CPF Special Account (SA) or Retirement Account (RA), you can claim tax reliefs. The best time to do this is January, because the CPF interest is calculated monthly but credited and compounded annually in December. This means that the earlier in the year you contribute, the more interest you will receive. For your spouse and siblings, you can claim tax reliefs only if they earned less than $4,000 last year. There is an exception for handicapped spouse and siblings. Cash top-ups for your parents, in-laws, and grandparents (including grandparents-in-law) are also not subjected to these income thresholds. Note: The maximum tax relief you can get from such top-ups is $8,000 each year. Example of tax reliefs from cash top-ups to CPF accounts Without CPF Top-up With CPF Top-up My annual income $70,000 $70,000 Cash top-up to my own CPF SA - $8,000 Cash top-up to Loved One’s CPF SA - $8,000 Tax payable on Chargeable Income $2,580 $1,460 *based on earned income relief of $1,000, using IRAS tax calculator Get more CPF ‘hacks’ to grow your nest egg Next, is the Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS), a voluntary savings scheme that helps you build up your retirement nest egg with tax-free gains. Each $1 you put in the SRS is eligible for $1 of tax relief. The exact amount you can contribute depends on your residency status. Singaporeans and Singapore Permanent Residents can contribute up to $15,300 while foreigners can contribute up to $35,700. Note that the maximum tax reliefs that you can claim in total is $80,000. Upon reaching the statutory retirement age (currently 62), you're free to make a lump sum withdrawal or spread it out over 10 years. Do note that all withdrawals after the retirement age are subject to 50% tax concession, including annuity streams. Remember to invest your SRS funds to earn higher interest, as leaving it idle only gets you 0.05% each year. Some investments to consider include Singapore Savings Bonds (SSBs), Singapore Government Securities (SGS), bonds, shares, fixed deposits, foreign currency fixed deposits, unit trusts, or single-premium insurance.

      "8 financial tips for women By Lorna Tan  If you’ve only got a minute:  In the past decades, more women have been getting an education and entering the workforce. There are also more women holding management roles. All this harbours well for the fairer sex. With greater income potential, women now have the means to be financially savvy. Still, the journey to financial freedom starts with a plan. Financial planning allows women to map out their goals based on their present circumstances and future needs, as well as identify and close any gaps. However, there are certain obstacles women may face, particularly those who take a break from their career to devote time to raising a family or be caregivers to the elderly. Studies showed that more women than men had at one point taken a career break. This could result in reduced opportunities for career advancement and lower lifetime earnings compared with their male counterparts. Furthermore, women generally live longer than males – on average by five to eight years - so planning is of paramount importance to ensure they do not outlive their nest egg.  Here are 8 financial tips for you to stay on top on your finances. 1. A man is not a financial plan It is prudent for a woman to be financially independent and not rely completely on their spouses or anyone for that matter.  As women tend to live longer, a bigger nest-egg is usually required to fund their twilight years. This is partly because women generally live longer, and the family coffers would usually have little left over after spending on the children’s education and husband’s medical needs. Therefore, it is crucial for women to be self-reliant on money management. By empowering themselves continuously with the financial know-hows, they will be able to make informed decisions and manage their finances well. What can you do?  2. Safeguard your interests: Be involved in your family’s financial planning Some women prefer leaving financial planning to their more money savvy partners but fail to consider the consequences should unforeseen circumstances arise – death of their spouses. Who then takes charge of the finances? Are there sufficient funds to cover outstanding liabilities (for example, mortgage & car loan)? They might be in for a rude shock if little/nothing was done to cater for the needs of surviving family members. Separation and divorce can also pose risks for many women as they could be left with far less when a marriage breaks down. What can you do? 3. Gender pay gap: Don’t just save - make your money work harder for you Women are more likely to depend on their children, husband and family members for financial support. Being more nurturing in nature, they tend to focus more on the physiological needs of the family and are more likely than men to be employed in temporary work as they usually take on the caregiver role in the family, often resulting in a significant pay gap from their male counterparts. This has an impact on the extent they are prepared for their golden years. This gap means that women feel much less prepared for their future. What can you do?  4. Lower risk tolerance: Build confidence and start investing Despite saving more of their income than men do, women often invest less of it. And for those who do, they often tend to be more conservative and prefer less risky options than men. As a result, they are more likely to hold a higher proportion of their assets in cash or low-yield deposit accounts and might miss out on other attractive investment opportunities that can generate better returns. Essentially, money parked solely in low-yielding savings accounts will be eroded by inflation. Investing allows money to work harder through the re-investment and compounding of dividends and returns. What can you do? Start by understanding the basics of defining your goals, setting aside an adequate emergency fund and understanding your risk profile before investing. At all times, ensure your investment holdings are diversified by keeping a balanced portfolio of cash and investments that suit your needs (a mix of equities and fixed income). One way you can reduce the risk of investing, and avoid timing the market is to practise dollar-cost averaging. This means spreading out your investments over a longer period to enjoy the benefits of time diversification. For instance, $100 each month for a year, instead of $1,200 at one go. You can start by investing in low-cost index tracking exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or funds. The DBS Invest-Saver and robo-advisory platform digiPortfolio are good avenues for regular investing into ETFs and unit trusts from as low as $100 a month. And remember – always do proper due diligence and research, so you can make an informed investment decision. Learn and educate yourself on the various investment options and instruments. Find out what is suitable based on your risk profile and the available capital. Do not let the fear of losing money or fear of the unknown deter you from investing. Understand that investing requires calculated risk-taking to generate a higher rate of return. Ultimately, the investment journey should be aligned to your values and long-term financial plans and goals. 5. Time in the market: invest over a long-term horizon The old adage “it's not about timing the market, but about time in the market,” has been proven true over the years. Research shows that long-term investors who maintain a well-diversified portfolio will typically outperform those who try to capitalize on market turning points. Building wealth is about buying quality assets – equities, bonds, or unit trusts – and allowing time to help you build value. Naturally, it is obvious to jump in at the lows and cash out at the highs, but no one can predict the peaks and valleys of market returns. What can you do?  6. Female Illnesses & longer life expectancy: prepare for the unexpected As women tend to outlive men, they are far less likely to have a partner to care for them in old age. In addition, women are more prone to certain medical conditions like musculoskeletal problems and some critical illnesses such as breast/cervical cancers and/or pregnancy complications. What can you do?  7. Shop smartly: choose your credit cards wisely Apart from not having to fumble with cash and coins, many credit cards offer perks like retail points, airline miles, cash back or additional discounts so you can accrue some savings as you spend. When used responsibly and strategically, credit cards can be a very helpful financial tool. Understanding the mechanics of it and exercising the right kind of restraint at purchases can actually help you save or even earn significant amounts of money in the long run. When charging purchases to a credit card, you will be doing yourself a huge favour by selecting one that is more aligned to your lifestyle.  What can you do? Pro tip: Check on credit card promotions when you shop and dine. At all times, inculcate the habit of not overspending during shopping trips or shop impulsively online. Do note if your credit spending gets out of control, monthly payments and accumulated interest can become a problem. Always exercise discipline and spend within your means. 8. Set a realistic budget: use digital tools to set up a financial plan A realistic budget can help you avoid the pitfalls of overspending. Setting up a budget and managing debt is a foundational cornerstone of prudent financial planning. It will impact all other aspects of financial planning including your day-to-day cashflow, building up your savings and emergency funds, securing sufficient protection for yourself and your loved ones, and any plans to grow wealth in the long-term. What can you do? Use digibank to set up a holistic financial plan. It helps you monitor your cashflows, identifies gaps and offers customised tips and access to insurance and investments, as well as map out your future retirement income streams. Track your spending with the Money In & Money Out feature. Having a budget puts you in control of your money.

(Tip: always “pay yourself first!”) Digibank also allows you to sort your money inflows and outflows automatically into categories like transportation, shopping and so on, so you can set saving and spending targets and control them easily. In fact, you can start by tracking your spend on the go. Last but not least, always remember to live within your means and never be in debt.   Ready to start?

      "Boost your financial resilience By Lorna Tan If you’ve only got a minute:  Amid encouraging signs of a post-pandemic recovery, the financial health of most Singapore residents has improved by the end of 2020. But the lower income group (earning salary of $2,999 and below) – which experienced a significant income decline (more than 10%) – continue to struggle and were depleting their savings in the last quarter of 2020. These are some of the valuable insights we can cull from this crisis to help us plan for a more secure financial future. As economic conditions improve, so will people's financial situations. Yet, DBS’s analysis over the past year has shown that while some segments of the society have made concerted efforts in financial planning, there were many who have not been able to do so. For the less prepared, though policy support will be helpful in closing the gaps in times of crisis, it should never be a cure-all or a permanent solution. To better prepare for a sustainable financial future, rigorous and prudent financial planning should be a way of life for everyone going forward. Macroeconomic data does not reflect the full impact of the Covid-19 crisis on people’s income, savings and spending. To ascertain that, DBS analysed anonymised and aggregated data insights from 1.2 million retail customers to examine the effects of the pandemic on individuals’ financial wellness. This second report No Storm Lasts Forever, which is based on data collated at end of 2020, is part of DBS NAV Financial Health Series. The first report in this series - Same storm, different boat - was published in August 2020.  Here are 6 key highlights and financial planning tips from the second report. 1. Financial health of Singapore residents has improved across the board The share of customers who experienced a significant decline in income fell to 19% in December 2020, a 7-percentage points improvement as compared to 26% in May 2020. This reflects an improvement in the financial wellness of Singapore residents amid the recovery from the crisis. Among those affected, the extent of impact has also moderated. Tips Set up a robust and holistic financial plan to help you navigate through the uncertainties ahead and achieve wellness. Besides having adequate emergency savings to tide through rainy days and financial difficulties resulting from potential retrenchments and income losses, start accumulating wealth early, build passive income streams and/or continue to upskill to expand income opportunities via career progression and side hustles. 2. Sustainable support for lower-income group needed The lower-income group remained the worst hit, accounting for about half (49%) of customers who experienced income degradation. That said, the share of low-income earners who experienced severe income loss (more than 50% income decline) improved significantly by 9-percentage points to 42%, up from 51% previously. Tips To save more, increase income via secondary jobs or side hustles while reducing discretionary/unnecessary spend. Set up a realistic budget to gain more clarity on your saving and spend patterns. Be more discerning between needs and wants and adopt a more frugal lifestyle. This will help you save more when your pay goes up over the years.  3. Middle-aged workers still feeling the squeeze Middle-aged workers still accounted for the majority share of those who experienced income deterioration. In fact, almost half of those in this age group experienced income decline of more than 30%, though compared to the other age groups, middle-aged workers made the most significant progress during the economic recovery. A persistent increase was also observed in the unemployment rate of middle-aged workers. These findings suggest that this group will continue to face challenges, and therefore require sustained policy support. Tips The middle-age group, especially those who are fall in the sandwich class category, will require more help in their financial planning since they would have multiple financial responsibilities toward their children, parents and own retirement. Ensure you have adequate insurance protection and a sound estate plan so that dependants can continue with their lifestyle should something untoward happen to you. Invest wisely with positive cashflows in suitable investments to achieve both short and long-term financial goals. 4. Pandemic prompted customers to save more Emergency savings of all income groups rose amid the crisis and reached peak levels in June 2020, before tapering off gradually as economic conditions improved. For example, the emergency funds of customers who earn more than $10,000 peaked at an amount equivalent to 4 months’ worth of salary. Tips It is recommended that you set aside enough emergency funds to cover at least 3 to 6 months of expenses, and more if you have dependants. Doing so will enable you and your family to tide over rough patches and avoid the need to liquidate your investments at an unfavourable time and price. In addition, it is prudent to monitor your discretionary expenses and pay your bills in full promptly every month to avoid incurring additional fees.  5. Spending varied at different stages of pandemic As the pandemic situation improved, so did the propensity to spend. From August to December 2020, spending steadily rose for all income groups. Expenditure in December across all income groups was significantly higher than that in April. More specifically, discretionary spending has picked up compared with spending on essential items as economic prospects improve. This growth in spending could be due to several factors, such as a higher propensity to spend during the school holidays and Christmas period. After months of perceived gloom, there was pent-up demand for goods as consumers rewarded themselves. The year-end spike in cash outflows could also be due to top-ups to Central Provident Fund (CPF) accounts and the Supplementary Retirement Scheme to qualify for personal income tax reliefs. Indeed, the CPF Board saw a 40% y-o-y increase in CPF top-ups to $3bn under the Retirement Sum Topping-Up Scheme in 2020. In the last three months of 2020 alone, the Board saw a substantial increase in top-ups of $1.2bn. Tips Our experience of living within the constraints of social distancing due to the pandemic last year has taught us that it is possible to reduce discretionary spend when the need arises. Check out the Plan & Invest tab on digibank to help you keep track of your spending in different categories, make realistic adjustments, and set up a financial plan to achieve financial wellness. It is timely to use this period to inculcate a thrifty habit and learn to defer gratification for bigger future financial rewards. Some of the challenges in transitioning pandemic-savings habits to the post pandemic world include the person’s money mind-set or attitude to money, exuberance, positive consumer sentiment and the perceived need to reward himself or herself after months of austerity. Below are several saving strategies adopted during the crisis that can become long-term habits over time. This is partly because the new normal will see more people working from home for longer periods of time compared with previously. They include: CPF members are encouraged to top up their CPF Special or Retirement Account each year in January rather than in December to start earning interest earlier and reap the benefits of compounding. By doing so, you could earn 20% more interest on your savings in 10 years. For example, by topping up $7,000 annually in January for 10 years, you will get $17,100 in interest, compared with $14,000 if you made top-ups in December.  6. Potential “cliff effect” from the mortgage deferment scheme not a major concern According to the bank’s data, only 8% of existing customers under the mortgage deferment scheme required a relief extension. This potentially alludes to a better-than-expected cash flow situation for most households, where the reduced monthly instalments are expected to cover interest and partial principal repayments for most individuals. Nonetheless, continual support for the vulnerable group – comprising individuals who experienced a bigger income degradation or lost their jobs due to the pandemic – remains imperative. Furthermore, different groups of individuals have responded to the mortgage deferment scheme differently. While some individuals (~31%) have tapped on the scheme arising from real financial need (i.e., reduced or loss of income, cash flow difficulties during COVID-19), others may have been more savvy (~17%) in tapping the scheme to free up cash to put into investments. The remaining ~52% customers do not invest and have mixed characteristics; most of the customers have positive cashflow or a few months of emergency funds. Tips Affordability is key when it comes to buying a big-ticket item like property. So do your sums carefully and find out if you can commit to the mortgage payments over time, before signing on the dotted line. Lenders will assess your monthly income, debt, credit score and a variety of other factors to determine how much you can afford. For instance, financial institutions use the TDSR and MSR measures to ascertain your ability to repay the home loans, as well as an indication of your financial health. It is also prudent to do your due diligence and empower yourself with information on government subsidy schemes and suitable mortgage packages that can offer savings. For those who have deferred their home loans, do note that interest will continue to accrue on the principal amount deferred, equating to a larger sum to be repaid, which places additional pressure on you when the moratorium ends. Consider how you can resume repayments when the relief measures end. Some tips include reducing other debt obligations such as non-essential insurance payments and credit card loans to enhance your financial position. Approach your bank early for help if you have payment issues especially those who saw >25% income impact. Ask your lender for mortgage extension relief. In the light of the low interest rate environment, you can also consider refinancing your home loan to potentially enjoy some savings. Do a cost benefit analysis and consider if you may be subject to penalties, subsidy claw back, legal cost, administration fees and a lock-in period. Ready to start?

      "8 tips to recession-proof your finances  If you’ve only got a minute:  It is difficult to avoid seeing the terms “global recession”, “sell-off”, “bear market” and “retrenchment” staring at you in the face these days, no thanks to the global supply chain crunch and high inflationary environment. With the prospect of recession rearing its ugly head, it is prudent to start preparing for tough times and get a better handle on our personal finances. Some of us may face the possibility of suffering a wage cut or worse still, losing our jobs. Even for those who manage to keep their jobs, the high inflation could significantly reduce purchasing power and erase the value of savings. The best insurance against the risk of unemployment is having a sound financial plan with adequate emergency cash, constantly upgrading our financial know how and skills set, and the willingness to look for income opportunities even if it means working outside our comfort zone. Here are 8 tips to recession-proof your finances.  1. Assess your financial health Take the opportunity to review your financial situation and make your financial plan more resilient to prepare for the uncertainties that lie ahead. Do ensure that you have set aside enough emergency cash for the rainy day, pay down your debts especially those that incur high borrowing costs like credit card bills, and review your essential insurance needs like term insurance (especially if you are servicing a mortgage) and healthcare cover. Check out the Plan & Invest tab on digibank to help you track, protect and grow your money in a convenient manner. 2. Tighten your belt Keep a tight lid on your cash flows and monitor your spending habits easily with digibank. Detail your money flows and look for ways to prioritise your spend on needs and wants. A realistic budget will help you crystallise your income and expenses as well as your assets and liabilities, and help you track them effectively. Your starting point would be to cut down on discretionary services or items you don’t need. They would include anything that you would typically consider as a luxury or a lifestyle expense.  3. Review your home loan With rising home loan interest rates, it is timely to review your mortgage loan and work out the costs and benefits of refinancing or changing your loan package, especially if your lock-in period is over. Do work out the associated fees and potential penalties for partial and full loan redemption.  4. Keep your job and upgrade your skills sets Do not be complacent in your job and find ways to enhance your skills sets constantly. That is one of the best ways to cushion yourself from being laid off when the company decides to go on a cost-cutting exercise. It will also be easier for you to find another job faster if you have constantly upgraded and kept your skills and knowledge relevant. Make use of the SkillsFuture Credit Top-ups of $500 by evaluating what are the suitable job improvement courses that you can attend to enhance your skillsets, before it expires in December 2025. Older Singaporeans aged 40 to 60 get another $500 with the same expiration date. And if you have not used the previous credit top-up of $500, take advantage of that too as it has no expiry date. If you are a fresh graduate in a sunset industry or are in an industry temporary disrupted by the recession, you can also turn to SkillsFuture to pick up in-demand skills in sunrise industries.  5. Preserving and accumulating wealth Depending on your time horizon and risk profile, consider investing your surplus cash in suitable and diversified investments to take advantage of the power of compounding and make your savings work harder for you during this period marked by market sell-downs and uncertainty. However, do ensure that you do so with savings that you do not need in the short-term, partly because investments come at a risk and you need time to ride out the market volatility.  To mitigate the uncertainty, do not put all your eggs in one basket and spread out your investments over a period such as via a regular savings plan, rather than investing all at one go. Many retail investors lose their hard-earned money during economic downturns because they had invested in a single company or in a single sector. Diversification is key.  6. Look for income opportunities If you are asked to take unpaid leave or become retrenched, consider your knowledge and skills sets, and look for job opportunities even if they are in sectors outside your comfort zone. Update your resume and use your network of contacts to source for jobs, including contract or temporary jobs. If your cash flow situation is very tight, consider liquidating some of your non-essential insurance policies or find out if your insurers allow “premium holidays”, so you can take a break from paying regular premiums while maintaining your cover.  7. Eligibility for government cash payouts and reliefs Check your eligibility for government cash payouts such as GST Vouchers and Assurance Package (AP) for GST to tide you over this challenging period. These cash payouts are meant to help Singaporeans cushion the impact of the GST increase in this high inflationary environment. In addition, check your eligibility for government schemes such as the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme, which is aimed to help senior Singapore Citizens, who have not reached their BRS, build their retirement savings.  8. Continue your education If you have always thought of pursuing higher education, this may be a good time. Ensure that your next level of learning such as a diploma, a degree or an MBA is in a field that will be employable and ride out this challenging period while studying. If you are a fresh graduate and have the means to, you can also consider furthering your studies during this period with the view that the economy will rebound after graduation. That said, further education can be expensive; do your sums to ensure you are able to afford it. It is prudent to continually upgrade your financial know how.

      "It's time to put your bonus to good use By Lorna Tan  If you’ve only got a minute:  The first quarter of the year is usually the time of the year when you look forward to the most - when you receive your well-deserved annual bonus. Surely this is the chance to spend it on that trip in your wishlist, or the new watch that you have been eyeing. While it is great to pamper yourself with splurges, you can also put your bonus to good use to achieve a sustainable financial future. Let us take a closer look at 7 ways you can utilise your bonus wisely. 1. A buffer for rainy days Bonuses are like mini windfalls, not guaranteed and likely to depend on both the performance of the individual and the company. As such, it is prudent to save some as a buffer for the rainy day. It is recommended to set aside emergency cash to cover at least 3 to 6 months of your monthly expenses, and more if you have dependants. Doing so will enable you to tide over tough times and counter financial difficulties resulting from potential job retrenchments and wage cuts. It will also avoid the need to liquidate investments, just to raise cash, at an unfavourable time and price. If you have not parked the required amount of emergency savings yet, start by setting a goal and saving towards it with your annual bonus.  2. Pare down debts with high interest fees While most Singaporeans have some form of debt, the unsecured loans (e.g. outstanding credit card balances) are the ones you should try to clear first, due to the risk of incurring additional fees because of the high interest rates. It is prudent to set aside a portion of your bonus to do this, if there are such outstanding payments to be made. Do note that a credit card debt of $2,000 might take you almost 30 years to pay off entirely if you are merely repaying the monthly minimum payment, assuming an interest rate of 18% per annum. By using your year-end bonus to settle such debts, you can save on interest payments in the long run. These savings can be translated into additional cash for you to save and invest to boost your financial strength. 3. Make your money work harder If you have set aside enough emergency cash and insurance cover, invest your positive cash flows to make your money work harder. So consider allocating a portion of your bonus (we recommend you apply this rule to your monthly salary too) into regular investment plans. This will help you enjoy a lower investment cost over time and help you ride out the market volatility. It will also place you in an advantageous position to receive a bigger windfall or bonus in the later stages of your life when your investments bear much fruit. If you are a newbie, start with baby steps while you empower yourself with knowledge on investing to increase your understanding and confidence. You can consider signing up for a Regular Savings Plan like the DBS Invest-Saver, which allows you to invest a fixed amount into investments that include exchange-traded funds and unit trusts. Another way is to consider DBS digiPortfolio – a low-cost robo-advisory platform – that offers access to managed portfolios of securities. The asset allocation will depend on your risk profile so that you can still sleep peacefully at night while investing. Alternatively if you prefer to exercise more autonomy in your investments, you could invest in Equities. But do your due diligence first. As a guideline, you can aim to have an Invested Assets to Net Worth ratio (Assets minus Liabilities) of at least 50%.  4. Plan for the long-term While short-term needs are important, being mindful of building a nest egg for long-term financial objectives like financial freedom, is essential. Starting to save and invest early for, say retirement, can go a long way especially if have a long-time investing horizon to reap the benefits of compound interest. For instance, by simply saving $500 a month and growing your savings at 6% per year, you will be sitting on a significant sum of about $1 million in 40 years. To help you, consider using digital tools like the financial and retirement advisory tool DBS Plan & Invest tab in digibank that offers guidance on identifying and closing your money gaps as well as a simulation facility to project your income streams over the years. 5. Top-up your retirement savings Consider optimising government schemes like the Central Provident Fund (CPF) and the Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) to grow your retirement pot. CPF accounts offer attractive interest rates of up to 6% a year. Doing so early will allow the compounding to work in your favour. Cash top-ups under the CPF Retirement Sum Topping-Up Scheme to certain recipients will result in potential tax savings too, subject to conditions. And the recipients will benefit from higher monthly payouts for life in their golden years. Your CPF savings which yield at least 2.5% per year can be invested under the CPF Investment Scheme, if you would like your money to work harder for you. In addition, contribute to the SRS to achieve some tax savings and invest your SRS savings to grow your retirement monies over time. With proper planning, it is possible not to pay tax on these SRS savings during your penalty-free withdrawal years.  6. Invest in yourself Investing doesn’t have to be limited to the financial markets. You can also set aside a portion of your bonus to increase your income opportunities via upskilling of relevant skillsets ranging from digital to physical. The benefits of learning a new skill can far outweigh its short-term cost. So, consider putting your SkillsFuture credits to good use or reduce out-of-pocket course expenses by getting company funding. Learning a new skill will increase your knowledge which will enhance your readiness to take on a larger portfolio or scope at work. This will give you both a renewed sense of motivation and support for promotion opportunities. Furthermore, your efficiency will likely be enhanced leading to improved work-life balance. Having additional skills will also help you to re-invent yourself and be open to secondary jobs and/or side hustles.  7. Reward yourself Your bonus is a reminder and validation of how hard you have worked throughout the year. To encourage yourself, you can use it treat yourself to something nice – be it a good meal, a short vacation with family and friends, or a gift for your loved ones (or yourself!). Take this opportunity to give yourself a pat on the back for a year of hard work as you get ready for another great year ahead. However, avoid the temptation to splurge or go overboard. And do consider the other ways to utilise your bonus wisely as well. Ready to start? Check out digibank to analyse your real-time financial health.

      "What to look for in a financial advisor  If you’ve only got a minute:  The meaning of \"financial advisor” (FA) can vary from person to person. It can refer to someone licensed to sell insurance, a banker offering investment advice, or a certified professional providing guidance on tax optimisation and estate planning. It is safe to say that all the interpretations mentioned are valid. Indeed, there are various types of FAs offering different services. More importantly - regardless of the type of FA you engage - you want to be able to pick someone trustworthy and have confidence in.  Types of financial advisors FA from insurance companies One of the most commonly recognised types of FAs are from insurance companies. Typically, these FAs exclusively represent a single insurance brand and are authorised to promote only the products from one firm. They are known as tied agents or sometimes referred to as financial planners/insurance agents. Independent FA IFAs are similar to the ones above, except that they can provide advice on the products from different life insurance firms. In other words, they are not tied to any specific company and can recommend products from a range of insurers, banks and asset managers. Besides insurance, IFAs may also offer financial advisory advice on investment products like unit trusts and retirement planning services. If you are one who prefers having access to a broader range of products, going with an IFA may be a sound option. Bank relationship managers (RMs) Many banks have their own FAs, otherwise known as RMs. They are responsible for managing and nurturing the relationship between clients and the bank. Some of the main duties of a RM include: You could have the impression that you need to have a certain amount of money (6 figure-sum) before the RM would even talk to you. Well, this is no longer the case. If you have been to a bank branch recently, you might have seen some bank staff coming to talk to you while you are in the queue. These RMs can usually provide advice on a wider range of products, including savings, home loans, insurance and investments. Online platforms In recent years, there has been a surge in the popularity of online platforms that provide segmented financial planning services, such as insurance planning or investment planning. To use these platforms, you typically need to have some financial knowledge and at least a basic understanding of the products you are considering. While there are advantages to using software for financial advice, such as potentially feeling less pressure to purchase products, some may still prefer human interaction and the reassurance that they are able to reach out to a customer service representative when necessary. As such, some of these online platforms boast hybrid services combining algorithm-directed portfolio services with human interaction capabilities. Read more: digiPortfolio: A robo-advisor for all Selecting a financial advisor It is vital to do your research before you decide on your FA.   Here are 6 key considerations: 1. How much financial advice is needed Everyone has varying levels of financial literacy and will therefore need different levels of advice. Do you already have your financial plan worked out and only require access to certain financial instruments? Or are you unsure about where and how to start financial planning? Thinking through these questions can help to narrow down which type of the above FA can fulfil your requirements. 2. Credentials and track record The first time you meet with your FA, make a note to ask about their credentials – the type of certifications, years or experience, as well as their track record. Doing so can help you gain a better sense of their qualifications and expertise in helping you meet your financial goals. 3. Range of solutions provided If you are looking at a more holistic suite of financial instruments, do your due diligence and find out which financial institutions offer such advisory service and/or tools. Look for an FA who can provide the specific services you need, as well as the product offerings you are looking at. A comprehensive financial plan should at least include financial planning, savings, protection, investments and retirement planning.  4. Trust It is essential to have an FA you can trust, especially since you will be disclosing confidential information about your finances, life circumstances and family situation. In addition to having financial expertise, a trustworthy FA should have a strong ethical code, the ability to empathise with you and the skills to communicate complex financial information in simple terms. Take some time to research and speak to a few FAs to ensure a good fit. You should feel confident and comfortable in the guidance and advice they provide. 5. How an FA is remunerated Typically, there are 3 ways in which FAs are remunerated. They can either charge a fee, earn a commission from the financial products that you bought (insurance policies) or invested in (unit trusts), or simply be paid a salary by their employer. Some of them may also earn a basic salary with additional commission. FAs should be transparent about their compensation structure to ensure that their recommendations are in your best interests, regardless of how they’re compensated. 6. Level of service required Are you looking for someone who can help you map out your financial journey, and recommend the right solutions as your life change and progress? Or are you simply looking for personal access to buying the financial products you want? Do you need the human touch – someone to call or meet, or do you prefer executing your financial decisions through the click of a mouse?\n",
      "\n",
      "With these in mind, you should now have a better idea of what to consider when selecting an FA. In part 2, we will talk about what is expected during the financial advisory process.  Before meeting your FA The first meeting with your FA will most likely be a get-to-know-you session. It may be helpful to reflect on your financial objectives and requirements prior to this meet up. Some questions that you may want to ask yourself include: After considering these questions, you can discuss your answers or raise other queries with your FA during the appointment. Financial Advisory Process In Singapore, all FAs are required to conduct a Financial Needs Analysis (FNA) prior to any product recommendations with their clients. It involves a series of questions to access your financial situation to identify any needs/gaps you may have.\n",
      "\n",
      "The information requested may be very personal – such as your financial objectives, employment status, liabilities, assets, existing insurance coverage and current investment portfolio. It is important for you to be as transparent and truthful for the FNA to be useful. However, if you are using a digital advisory service, then the information you need to provide may be less detailed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Depending on your FA, he/she may make immediate recommendations or take a longer time to get back to you with a more comprehensive solution. Before you purchase any products, consider the following: Bear in mind that you are not obligated to make any purchases. Stay focused on your financial goals and only acquire or invest in products that serve your needs.    What to do after the meeting Congratulations on taking a step towards achieving your financial goals! After taking into account the recommendations and purchasing the necessary products, it’d be useful to store all the information in a folder for future reference. You can also click on the “Plan” tab on DBS digibank and sync your data using SGFindex to have a complete view of your finances in one place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do note that the FNA reflects your financial situation at a specific point of time. Your FA should have regular follow ups with you at least once a year for a portfolio review. You may also want to re-examine your protection needs as your life circumstances change - such as marriage, parenthood, a change in career or retirement timeline. \n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, managing your finances should be a process, not a one-off solution. This is also why choosing a good FA is important - one who will provide ongoing support and guidance throughout your financial journey. Ready to start?

      "Be financially well-prepared to seize opportunities  If you’ve only got a minute:  The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc and impacted the lives of many people globally. As we witness the spiral of misery exacerbated by fresh outbreaks, loss of jobs and a deep recession, let us not sink into hopelessness and despair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, there are valuable insights that we can distil from this crisis to help us plan for a more secure financial future. Let us focus on what we can control – like boosting our financial resilience by budgeting and investing prudently, and empowering ourselves with knowledge – and do them well.  As Singapore continues its efforts in containing the pandemic and its economic repercussions, DBS notes that the impact on individuals’ income is far deeper and broad-based. Macroeconomic data does not reflect the full impact of the COVID-19 crisis on people’s income. So, to ascertain that, we leveraged our bank-wide database of 1.2 million retail customers to examine the effects of the pandemic on individuals’ financial wellness from March to May 2020. \n",
      "\n",
      "The inaugural research paper Same Storm, Different Boat is part of a new series of research studies titled DBS NAV Financial Health that will be conducted on a regular basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are 8 key highlights and financial planning tips from this study. 1. Deepening income divide The pandemic has sharply outlined the differences between two income groups. The lower income group is facing threats to job security and sandwiched between the fall in income and inadequate savings, while the financially able are capitalizing on the opportunities from financial market corrections. The Covid-19 pandemic has deepened the income divide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tips: The impact of the pandemic is uneven. The more financial cushioning you have, the better you can sail through tough economic times. This highlights the importance of setting up a robust financial plan to achieve wellness. 2. Lower-income group is bearing the brunt Among customers with more than 10% income decline, the impact on lower-income workers is more pronounced. The lower income earners ($2,999 & below) accounted for about 49% of customers that experienced a drop in pay checks. About 51% of them saw their incomes declining by more than 50%. In comparison, the impact on the higher income groups is considerably modest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tips: Besides having enough emergency savings to tide through possible retrenchments and income losses, start building passive income streams early and/or upskilling to find income opportunities via side hustles. 3. The middle-age group is the new vulnerable segment Amongst the customers that saw more than 10% decline in income, as many as 79% are below age 55 and of which, those aged 35-44 are the worst affected. The income of 56% in this age group fell by more than 30%. This is partly due to the current policy measures which have focused on job losses (in the case of older workers) and the lower-income group. The middle age group also coincides with being sandwich class with more financial commitments such as having 2 sets of dependants.  Tips: While financial planning is for everyone, those who are in the middle-age group will likely require more help in their financial planning since they would have multiple financial responsibilities, such as servicing insurance premiums, mortgage loan, and having to support parents and their children. In addition, they would also need to set aside money for their retirement. 4. Lack of adequate emergency cash In May, 64% of customers who have experienced a significant fall in income had less than 3 months of emergency funds. In fact, a sizeable 42% had less than 1 month of emergency funds. Amongst those earning $2,999 and below, 33% has less than 3 months of emergency cash, and of which, 22% has less than 1 month of emergency funds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tips: Set aside enough emergency cash to cover at least 3 to 6 months of expenses, and more if you have dependants. Doing so will enable you and your family to tide over rough patches and avoid the need to liquidate your investments at an unfavourable time. In addition, monitor your discretionary expenses and pay bills in full every month. 5. Those with less savings face higher risks Those harder hit by income declines have less savings. About 24% of customers hit by a sharper decline in income of 30% or more have less than 1 month of emergency funds; 14% of customers earning less than $2,999 and experiencing more than 30% decline in income, have less than 1 month of emergency funds. \n",
      "\n",
      "The situation for this group - lower wage workers with little savings - is exceptionally dire. They are heavily reliant on their salary to meet their monthly cash flow needs. A sharp decline in salary would inflict significant stress on their livelihoods. \n",
      "\n",
      "Tips: Set up a budget to crystalize your money flows. Identify your needs and wants and aim to reduce unnecessary spend over time while seeking income opportunities via upskilling. 6. The well prepared are capitalizing on market opportunities These are individuals who are in the best position to seize investment opportunities that present themselves only during a crisis. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here are their 3 main characteristics:\n",
      "The more you earn, the more likely you will invest\n",
      "The propensity to invest rises with income level. Those earning above $10,000 invest significantly more. This group has the highest percentage of investors at 12.2% for retail customers and 15.8% for digibank “Plan” tab users.\n",
      "\n",
      "Higher savings equates to higher propensity to invest \n",
      "DBS research shows that higher income earners invest more. For those who have invested via DBS, there is a positive correlation between the level of emergency funds and income. For example, 54% of our customers in the income bracket of more than $10,000 have more than 3 months emergency funds; compared to just 24% in the less than $3,000 income bracket.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your life stage affects investment decisions \n",
      "This is true across all income brackets. The 25 to 35 age group has a higher tendency to invest likely because of their lower financial commitments. It could also be that millennials are more financially savvy and have embarked on their financial journey at a younger age.  The 35 to 54 age group suffers a dip in their ability to investment, partly because they are at a life stage where financial commitments are highest – marriage, mortgage loan, car loan, insurance and children's education. \n",
      "\n",
      "The inclination to invest jumps for the 55-64 age band. This is likely due to lower financial commitments as both mortgage repayments and children's education support end. Another reason is their access to CPF savings which are likely ploughed back into investments. \n",
      "\n",
      "Tips: The financially well prepared are the ones who understand the importance of financial planning, earn comfortably above the median salary, have lower financial commitments and have built up enough emergency funds to enable them to weather through the crisis and the flexibility to capitalize on market opportunities. 7. Debunks the myth that retail investors are inactive relative to institutional investors and tend to \"buy high sell low\" Retail investors saw the plunge in stock prices as a buying opportunity. In the first 6 months of 2002, retail investors likely outperformed the institutions, buying as the stock market plunged in March and trading the market swings in 2Q20.  The Singapore stock market's weekly institutional and retail funds flow showed that retail investors traded the stock market volatility much more successfully than institutional investors, by buying the dips and selling the bounces. \n",
      "\n",
      "So how did the institutions and retail investors perform year-to-date? DBS research indicated that retail investors outperformed the institutional investors and the benchmark Straits Times Index (STI). The retail investor base was down by 8.2%, outperforming the institutions (-15%) by 6.8 percentage-points and the STI (-17.8%) by 9.6 percentage points.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tips: A crisis is not all bad news. Opportunities are available to those who are prepared to seize them. Empower yourself with the investment knowledge so that you perform due diligence, ask the right questions, understand your actions and make informed decisions. 8. Don’t waste a good crisis There had been 5 economic recessions since Singapore's independence including the current pandemic. The duration between recessions ranged from 2.5 to 12 years. The average Singaporean can expect to experience 3 to 5 major recessions throughout their 40-year employment stint from age 25 to 65. \n",
      "\n",
      "For a person in the age band 55 to 64 that has the highest propensity to invest, the current pandemic would be their fourth or fifth recessions. DBS believes it is this group, especially those in the income bracket in excess of $10,000, who have most likely bought stocks from March till May 2020. The best investment opportunities often present themselves during an economic crisis. \n",
      "\n",
      "The average post-recession bull market recovery was a solid 141% return over a 381-day period. The stock market behaviour in the past 4 recessions is on the side of the investors who stay invested, assuming one has the holding power to ride out any remaining near-term price uncertainty and sit through a potential recovery over the next 12 months or beyond.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tips: Investing requires discipline, an understanding of your behavioural biases and holding power. It is important to only invest idle funds so that you do not need to liquidate your investments prematurely due to cashflow issues. Adopt a long-term and diversified investment approach to reap the benefits that come with the power of compounding.\n",

      "6 ways we are making banking accessible  If you’ve only got a minute:  Banking has seen significant changes with the help of technology in the last few years. You no longer have to leave your home to open a bank account; applying for a credit card can be done instantly online; deposits and transfers are made right from your mobile phone. But this may not come naturally for many others. There are those who do not know what to do with their savings, or a non-citizen who needs a bank account to receive their salary. Or those who have started a business to better society yet find themselves worrying about financing and paperwork. Today, we remain committed to be the bank that you can trust and partner through life and have set out to make banking not just simple, but also accessible for our community. Learn more about our initiatives below and share them with your network! 1. Partnering parents in money management Learning to manage money doesn’t start from your first pay check - it should begin as early as possible. One way we are enabling the journey at an early age is through a wearable device for children, the POSB Smart Buddy, that’s like a watch. With a tap, your child can check the balance of his/her allowance, pay for books and meals in school and at selected merchants, and even track the number of fitness steps taken. And it’s one less worry for you, too. Paired with a mobile app, you can manage your child’s allowance and stay updated on their expenses – and most importantly, guide your child along the initial years of his/her money management journey. You can even set alarms and reminders to encourage them to regular meals or sleep early to stay healthy! 2. Facilitating access to emergency funds for a loved one It is hard to imagine the pain of seeing a loved one slip away mentally while they are physically present. If you are an immediate family member of someone who has lost his or her mental capacity, you can apply to withdraw up to $5,000 from their bank accounts to care for their - and their dependents’ - needs. We have worked together with the Family Justice Courts to simplify the application process to be as easy as possible. Find out more about the three-step process here. 3. Supporting our NSFs with Save As You Serve (SAYS) A rite of passage for every young adult male in Singapore, National Service (NS) is a time to learn more about themselves, the country they live in, and why their service is of utmost importance. POSB  is set up to help our NSFs make the most of their allowance while serving the nation. Through the SAYS programme, you can unlock higher interest rates when you open a DBS Multiplier account, credit your NS allowance and spend with PayLah!. You can also enjoy up to 2% cash rebate on their purchases with the SAFRA DBS Debit Card or HomeTeamNS-Passion-POSB Debit Card. 4. Making banking easy for work permit holders Singapore was built by many who have left their families and loved ones behind in their home countries to pursue different opportunities on this small island. An integral part of our community, work permit holders fill in various roles here ranging from domestic helpers to healthcare workers, or as cleaners to the construction workers who labour every day to build the very homes we live in. We value your contributions and your toil.

Helping social enterprises focus on your mission We recognise the work social enterprises do and their role in bettering the world we live in. As you seek to provide sustainable employment opportunities for many others toward the greater good, we believe your banking needs should be the least of your worries.

If you run a social enterprise, let us help your efforts be on the cause and not the cost of doing so. 6. Helping our community learn more about money It’s a scenario we’re familiar with. You receive your salary and within days, you’re wondering why your bank balance has dwindled. Even if it does not happen to you, you could hear from someone in this position.

      "Debunking personal finance myths By Lorna Tan If you’ve only got a minute: With the plethora of financial information available at our fingertips, it is no wonder that we sometimes feel overwhelmed. This is particularly so during this period when there is so much noise due to the market volatility, no thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic. This information overload may paralyse some of us to a state where we procrastinate in acting on our finances because we lack clarity on what is appropriate for us. It is important to get our money management beliefs right because how we think shape our behaviour and actions. What’s fact and what’s fiction? Here are 4 common personal finance myths.  Myth 1: Only those with high pay can afford to set up a financial plan It is not how much you earn but what you do with your pay. Some of you may think that whatever you set aside is too small to make a difference. But remember that little drops of water make the mighty ocean. If the saving habit does not come naturally to you, start by differentiating between your needs and wants and set up small savings goals of at last 10% of your pay and most of your bonuses. Learn that by “paying yourself first” (save first before paying expenses), you will be able to build your hard-earned savings to a nice pile which you invest, after setting aside emergency funds and getting some essential protection like healthcare. With the help of online calculators and digital tools, there is really no reason why you cannot up your game in money management.      Myth 2: Financial planning works in a linear manner Some of you may believe that financial planning works in a sequential manner, that is, it progresses from one stage to another in a series of steps. That is not true. For instance, some people wrongly believe they can only start retirement planning after they have set aside what’s needed for their kids’ education. They do not realise how this decision will impact other areas of their financial plan and adversely impact their future. By then, their resources would be drained, and they may end up working longer, lowering their retirement lifestyle expectations and/or turning to their kids for financial assistance. Planning for our kids’ education and our retirement needs can go hand in hand. In fact, it is prudent to plan for our retirement early and as we plan for our other milestones in life. This is partly due to the magic of compounding. The earlier you start, the harder your money can work for you. Even the difference of just 10 years can be significant. Let’s assume you are age 25 and invest $500 in an investment that earns 8%, and can top-up $50 a month. At age 65, the investment would have grown to about $186,700. If you wait until you’re 35, however, and do the same thing, you’ll have less than half as much, or about $80,000.  Myth 3: I shouldn’t invest beyond age 55 It is likely that most of our great grandparents and grandparents did not have to grapple with the undesirable prospect of outliving their financial resources. Most of them would have retired in their 50s or 60s and pass away about a decade later. But not for some of us. By 2030, the number of Singaporeans aged 65 and above is projected to double to 900,000. By then, 1 in 4 Singaporeans will be in that age group. Do you know that there are more than 1,600 Singapore residents who are aged 100 and older? The “double whammy” that we face of possibly living past 100 and the adverse impact of inflation which shrinks our idle money’s purchasing power, can be daunting. This is unless we take financial planning seriously and start acting early to be well prepared for a long lifespan and build multiple sustainable income streams to fund our golden years. The old adage of shifting all our assets to safer and low risk investments or to cease investing altogether when we reach 55 may not work for some of us who have long lifespans. It means we need to have a portion of our savings invested for the longer-term to take care of that scenario. What we invest in will depend on our diversification approach, risk profile and our understanding of investment products. If you’re planning to retire in the next few years, especially when a recession looks like it could be coming, it is prudent to have your first few years of income flows in cash or in near cash instruments. But don’t shy away from equities in your portfolio. Those are usually where you will get the most returns that can hedge against inflation.  Myth 4: Estate planning is for seniors Estate planning involves preparing for the smooth distribution of our wealth and assets (savings, insurance proceeds, property, personal belongings) upon our death. It also includes appointing responsible representatives who will manage our financial matters and property in the event we become mentally incapacitated. The tools that facilitate estate planning extend beyond writing a will and they include CPF Nomination, Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) and Advance Medical Directive. A good estate plan will ensure that there are enough financial resources for our loved ones to carry on when we are no longer around or are mentally unable to care for ourselves. It is a fallacy that estate planning is only useful for older people because firstly, we don’t know when we may become mentally incapacitated or die. Secondly, if we have not set up, say an LPA, our loved ones will have limited or no access to our insurance proceeds and payouts without the Court’s consent, should we suffer from mental incapacity.

      "Settling down in SG as a foreigner  If you’ve only got a minute:  Moving to a new country can be daunting. New rules and regulations to get used to, learning new cultures and habits and not to mention, being far from your loved ones. But you’d soon find that the little red dot is quite an easy country to navigate. Here, we share 7 practical tips on getting your finances in order while you settle into this sunny island! 1. Getting financial access One of the most important things to do first when you’re trying to settle into a new country is to get financial access. You can set up a savings account with a bank so that you can either transfer money from your foreign bank account to have emergency cash to use or for your company to credit your salary. For starters, you can set up a DBS Multiplier Account with a few quick taps on digibank app, without having to visit a branch. This account works just like a savings account, but more importantly, it allows you to enjoy 24/7 multi-currency convenience in one account, with SGD and 12 foreign currencies. Read more here. You will also have access to DBS Remit for convenient fund transfers at lower remittance fees and preferential foreign exchange rates. 2. Accommodation and Transportation Renting an accommodation is generally quite easy here in Singapore. Your choice of rental comes down to your budget, lifestyle and work location. If you are looking to save costs, you can choose to rent a single room, or live slightly further away from the Central Business District. Singapore is a small country so you can still get to town fast enough on public transport. Try to do an online search to see if any flat owners are renting their rooms so that you can save on the estate agent’s fee. The average rental price of a room in an HDB (public housing) ranges from $1,000 to $1,500 depending on the location and size of room. If you prefer to live in a private apartment, the cost can double. Other than the room, you may want to consider the availability of amenities around as well. Take for instance, rental A which costs $2,000 but the MRT is within a 10 minute walk, with easy access to a supermarket and food court just downstairs. On the other hand, rental B costs $1,500 but the nearest MRT and town centre requires a 15-minute bus ride. Which would you choose? In Singapore, it is unnecessary to own a car as public transport is fast, convenient and cheap. A car here is a big ticket item. In fact, it is one of the most expensive countries in the world to own a car! You can use a taxi or use private rider apps if you are in a rush. Doing so would still be cheaper compared to owning a car in Singapore.  3. Meal expenses Eating in Singapore can be relatively cheap depending on the choices you make. You can find food almost anywhere – in food courts, hawker centres, fast food outlets, restaurants and so on, etc. The good news is you can get to enjoy all types of food cuisines from a few dollars for a meal at a hawker centre. Otherwise, cooking at home can be an alternative. If you prefer this option, do look out for the availability to use the kitchen when you rent a place. Some landlords would prefer their tenants not to cook, whereas other smaller apartments may not come with a full kitchen. 4. Education If you are here with your family and have school-going children, looking for a suitable school would be a priority for you. If cost is a concern, you can enrol your child in a public school. The standard of education in Singapore is considered high internationally so you be assured. You can also take this opportunity to let your kids adapt to the lifestyle in Singapore and make some local friends. Otherwise, there are also international schools to choose from if you prefer one which follows your home syllabus. However, the school fees for international schools typically costs a 5-figure sum per year, so do take note.  5. Insurance As a foreigner, healthcare can be relatively expensive in Singapore, so you need to make sure you take out some form of insurance to cover the necessary costs. First, check if your company offer insurance coverage for staff, as well as any of your immediate family members. It is also important to check the extent of the coverage so that you might take up other insurance to close the gap. The last thing you want is to be ill, far from home and having to worry about expensive healthcare bills.  6. Savings Always save for a rainy day. Retrenchment may happen anytime, and this can be disastrous for a foreigner as you would still need to pay for ongoing costs such as rent, while job-hunting. The best way to save is to ensure that you put aside a fixed amount each month from your salary for savings. You can set up a standing instruction on your bank account to transfer a fixed amount each month into a savings account. Money tracking apps can be helpful for you to have a general idea of how you spend your money and which categories you could be overspending on, so that you can cut down your expenses. You can also click into the “Plan” tab on DBS digibank to have an overview of how you spend your money. 7. Retirement Planning Each country has its own retirement savings system - this could be derailed once you move overseas. The good news is that you can continue to save for your retirement right here in Singapore! If you are new to the country and are not a Permanent Resident(PR) yet, you can save for your retirement with the voluntary Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS). On top of helping you to save for your retirement, the SRS comes with tax relief benefits and even allows you to invest your funds. Here’s how it works: You can make a contribution to top up your SRS account as many times a year as you like, up to an annual limit of $15,300 for Singaporean citizens/PRs, and $35,700 for foreigners. By doing so, you are reducing your final tax payable by getting a dollar-for-dollar tax relief on your SRS contributions, during your income earning years. When you leave Singapore, you can either leave your SRS account open or close the account. If you close the account and you are not of statutory retirement age (at the point when you made your first SRS contribution) or have not fulfilled the 10-year parking period, you will be subjected to the full tax and 5% penalty. If you have fulfilled the 10-year parking period or have reached the statutory retirement age, you can do a penalty-free withdrawal at 50% taxable. Life in Singapore can be affordable and exciting, if you manage to have a grasp over your finances early and seize opportunities to save and manage your money more effectively! Ready to start?

      "4 tips for freelancers and gig workers  If you’ve only got a minute:  Gig workers are individuals who are compensated for completing temporary job assignments, as opposed to being employed by a company or organisation. If you’re part of the gig economy, such as a private-hire driver or a freelancer, and face income fluctuations, how can you effectively manage your finances to make the most of prosperous times and last through challenging periods? Here are 4 tips to help you manage your finances better. 1. Manage your money smartly As a gig worker, it is likely that you will be managing money inflows and outflows from clients and jobs on your own, which can get messy and tedious, especially if you’re counting on manual inputs. If you find yourself struggling with managing your money, you may want to consider using a digital personal finance tool or app. With digital tools, monitoring your finances can be stress-free and seamless. For example, The Plan & Invest tab on digibank, can give you a complete overview of your finances effortlessly.  Supercharged by the Singapore Financial Data Exchange (SGFindex) and secured with Singpass, you can connect your financial information from banks, CPF, HDB, IRAS to get a consolidated view of your financial data easily. This means bringing together everything, from your income, cash, CPF savings, property and investments to your expenses and loans, providing you clarity on your financial wellness based on your savings, protection and investments. Besides account balances and transactions, the app also provides insights on your expenses, and calculates your spending based on different categories such as food and transportation, to name a few. This allows you to set saving and spending targets, while giving you clarity on what you can do to improve your cashflows. Last but not least, the app also offers personalised financial insights and suggestions to empower you to make better financial decisions on the go. This could mean alerting you of higher-than-usual monthly expenses, how to grow your idle funds and alerting you of upcoming bill payments.  2. Grow your money – beyond saving – for rainy days A common trait across the gig economy is the lack of income stability. As a gig worker, you are likely to be paid on an ad hoc basis, and this exposes you to the uncertainty of having a consistent income stream should there be a lack of job assignments. Furthermore, your revenue can be significantly impacted should you fall ill or decide to take a holiday. Thus, it is crucial to have sufficient savings/emergency cash (at least 12 months of your monthly expenses) set aside as contingency.  Next step is to make your savings work harder. Consider setting up a high-yield savings account, such as the DBS Multiplier, to enjoy higher interest rates compared to the other ordinary savings accounts. In recognising the challenge of not having a fixed salary, enhancements have been made such that you can rely on dividend income (any amount works) from any dividend-yielding investments (such as Singapore Savings Bonds), instead of your salary to earn higher interest. Use the benefits of this high interest savings account to your advantage and grow your savings at an accelerated rate as you check off other key components of your financial plan such as insurance, investments and home loan.  3. New side gig: Hassle-free investing The next thing to look at is growing your wealth, so your money doesn’t sit idly in the bank and dwindle with inflation. The Plan & Invest tab on digibank can find you the right investments to grow your wealth. Simply provide answers to a few questions and the app will take care of the rest by recommending investments that align with your risk tolerance. For example, with DBS Invest-Saver, you can start investing with a fixed sum evert month (as little as $100 a month). Alternatively, consider robo-investing on digiPortfolio and enjoy personalised insights, tips, advice and a range of options to grow your money that match your needs. It fits the investment needs of both beginner and seasoned investors, and you get to choose from ready-made Global or Asia focused ETF portfolios. To sweeten the deal, earn higher interest in your Multiplier Account when you invest in digiPortfolio or Invest-Saver! 4. Optimise your daily, essential spends Getting more with less is a skill that is so useful. After all, if you reduce your expenses, you can set aside more money for other purposes such as saving or investing. Here’s how you can get more bang for your buck, especially from expenditure on essentials. Review your electricity plan With the current post-pandemic working arrangement, you may notice an increased time spent at home (especially if you spend most of your time working from home). This can result in an increase in your utilities bill. Consider reviewing your current electricity plan. Hop on over to DBS Home & Living Marketplace, the one-stop shop for your home and utility needs. Enjoy greater savings and flexibility with plans that fit your lifestyle and budget when you switch to an alternative electricity retailer. Discover DBS PayLah! perks Paylah! Is the ultimate everyday app for booking rides, booking tickets, ordering meals and more. Furthermore, you can earn and manage your card rewards points seamlessly, collect stamp cards that give you cashback and enjoy exclusive offers. For example, if you need a ride, simply book a taxi with the ComfortDelGro (CDG) app and pay using DBS PayLah!. Check out the multitude of DBS PayLah! promotions here.  Reduce interest paid on your home loan Whether you are contemplating the purchase of a home, or already own one, any savings made on this long-term commitment can accumulate significantly. Reducing the amount of interest paid on your home loan translates to having more financial resources for your everyday spending. If you are a new homeowner, enjoy cash bonuses when you take a new home loan with us. Find more here. If you already own a property, and wish to refinance your existing home loan, you may wish to check out the wide range of attractive fixed and floating home loan interest rate packages here.  All in all It is essential to channel the same motivation, energy and drive (you have as a gig worker), into your personal financial planning as well.

      "Just started work? Go forth and multiply If you're excited about getting your first salary and how far it will take you…well, here's what we have to say about it: go forth and multiply. If you don’t know how to get started, here's 6 tips to help you start multiplying your salary. #1: Adulting 101: Know where your money’s going No one really likes adulting, but it is a part of growing up.  Fearing that you are not maximising your salary? One of the ways to start is by saving before you spend. Try to set aside at least 10% of your salary as soon as it is credited into your bank account. You should also set budgets and track your expenses, no matter how small. One tip to consider is that you should set a larger monthly budget as compared to your schooling days. That’s because when you're \"adulting”, your expenses are likely to be higher than when you were a student. For instance, a new phone plan, increased transport costs (arising from overtime and cab fares), lunch and dinner out with your new colleagues. Perhaps you might even rent your own place. We’ve got your back. To help you navigate these changes, we’ve developed the Plan & Invest tab in digibank, a financial planning tool that helps you keep track of where your money’s going.  #2: Upgrade your childhood savings account When you're venturing deeper into the world of \"adulting\", you're bound to transact or even invest more – you probably won't have a choice. But you might have a choice is in the interest rates you can earn. For example, your childhood account is probably earning near-zero interest. But if you have a DBS Multiplier account and credit your salary into any DBS or POSB account, it works extra hard in the interest department. Even if you’re a freelancer in the gig economy, you can join the higher-interest category by crediting your dividends into any DBS or POSB account. This is just the “entry pass”. Here’s how you can get more interest by adding on one of these - credit card spend, home loan instalments, insurance payments or investments. When you do any of those, the interest rate on your account jumps…especially when your total eligible transactions pass S$500 per month. The more you add on, the more interest you earn. Interest game strong.  Applying for the Multiplier is basic. Everything can be done online. You never have to visit a branch or make 1,001 declarations over your identity and what you want to achieve in life. If you’re 29 or younger, you get even more. That’s because the “fall-below” service fee is waived for you. This feature is important because in your early years of working, there will be times you might fall short or need a little bit of extra cash. It’s frustrating – we know. In addition, if your monthly income and credit card/PayLah! Retail spend, investments, insurance or home loan add up to S$500 or more monthly, you get to enjoy 1.80% or more on your first S$50,000. So, this is our way of recognising your life's stages and helping you along the way. #3: Upgrade to your own credit card You probably own a debit card. And you might have gotten a supplementary credit card from your parents when you were on your overseas exchange. One of the most exciting #adulting things about getting your own pay is… getting your FIRST credit card. To make the most of it, use your DBS credit card as long as you're paying for something. For one, you earn points, cashback or miles. Two, it makes it so much easier to reach the next level of monthly transactions to qualify for the next level of interest rates with the Multiplier account.  There are so many ways to do this: hotpot dinner with your squad, mom's birthday present, the monthly donation to the children's charity or even when you fill up petrol. Meet Jack. He’s a first jobber who credits his monthly salary of S$3,500 into his DBS/POSB savings account and transacts in two categories.  Jack has a total eligible transaction of S$3,800 and gets a bonus interest of:  To unlock higher interest rates, Jack can purchase an insurance policy for protection and transact in 3 categories. His interest rate increases from 2.10% p.a. to 2.40% p.a. He could also open a joint account with his partner and credit their income into the joint account. This maximises both of their benefits as the Multiplier account will recognise the combined income and calculate interest based on this amount. #4: Stay protected You've probably heard that it's never too early to start an insurance policy. That sounds about right. While you might only be in your 20s, this is the perfect time to choose from life or term insurance policies. That’s because you pay less premiums when you’re younger and healthier. If you decide on an Endowment policy, you reap the benefits of compound interest, and get nearer to your marriage and first home goals. And if you buy a life insurance policy from DBS, it can tick off yet another Multiplier criteria. Score! (To see how much you can potentially earn, try our calculator here.) #5: Have a ‘lit’ break You may have just started work, but it won't be long before you'll be whispering these four words: \"I need a break.\" The struggle is real. Have a ‘lit’ vacation by using the multi-currency feature that comes with your bank account. If you have the Multiplier account, it’s simple: lock in your preferred exchange rate, link it to a Visa debit card, and you’re set to pay like a local. It’s super useful if you are travelling to a few countries, because there’s no need to call and brief us on your itinerary. Pay in London and Pounds are deducted; pay in Amsterdam and Euros are deducted. The system’s smart that way. #6: Grow with the flow A major coming-of-age concept is when you begin investing for the long-term. A regular (monthly) savings plan is the surest, steadiest way to multiply, but there is also the option to trade stocks via your DBS Vickers account. (Your stock purchases and dividends count towards the Multiplier.) Alternatively, using DBS Invest-Saver to trade in equities online or to contribute a lump-sum to unit-trusts qualifies you for the investment category in the months you make the purchase. The first 12 consecutive months are also recognized should you choose to make monthly contributions to your investments via DBS Invest-Saver. Disclaimers and Important Notice\n",

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING SPDR STI ETF VS Nikko AM STI ETF: What’s The Difference Between The 2 STI ETFs Listed On SGX? How should you choose between these two different ETFs tracking the Straits Times Index (STI)? by For those new to investing, putting your money in a benchmark country index is one of the easiest and safest ways to start growing your wealth. In Singapore, the benchmark index is the Straits Times Index (STI), and there are two STI ETFs – SPDR STI ETF and Nikko AM STI ETF – that we can invest in. What Is A Benchmark Index? A benchmark index of a country usually refers to the largest and most liquid stocks listed on its stock market. In Singapore, the Straits Times Index (STI) is made up of the 30 largest stocks (by market capitalisation) listed in Singapore. Combined, these companies account for approximately 80% of the entire market value of stocks listed in Singapore. Hence, how the 30 STI constituent stocks perform can be representative of how the overall Singapore market performs. The STI is comprised of: Read Also: Here’s How The Stocks Within The Singapore’s Straits Times Index (STI) Have Changed Since 1998 Country indexes can be found across all major economies. In Hong Kong, the benchmark index is the Hang Seng Index (HSI) made up of 50 of the strongest stocks listed in Hong Kong. In Australia, it is the ASX 200, comprising 200 of the strongest liquid stocks listed in Australia. In the USA, it is the S&P 500, made up of close to 500 of the strongest stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ. The FTSE 100 is the 100 largest stocks listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE). A benchmark index also serves the purpose of allowing investors to measure (or benchmark) their investment portfolio performance against the market returns. Of course, investors should aim to beat the market returns in any given year, otherwise, we would have been better off investing in the benchmark index rather than taking additional risks or actively trading our portfolio. How To Invest In The Benchmark Index? We can’t invest directly in the benchmark index. We have to rely on exchange traded funds (ETFs) that track the benchmark index by replicating its component stocks. In Singapore, there are two ETFs that track the Straits Times Index: 1) SPDR STI ETF; and 2) Nikko AM STI ETF. We can invest in these ETFs in the same way we typically invest in other stocks listed on SGX – via a brokerage account. With just a single investment into either of the STI ETFs, investors are able to gain broad exposure to the Singapore market. Read Also: Complete Guide To Investing In The STI ETF Which STI ETF Is Better – SPDR STI ETF or Nikko AM STI ETF? Since there are two STI ETFs, the common question is which should investors choose? Both the SPDR STI ETF and the Nikko AM STI ETFs aim to track the Straits Times Index (STI) as closely as possible. Here’s a comparison of its differences. #1 Fund Managers The most obvious difference is that the two STI ETFs are managed by different fund managers. The SPDR STI ETF is managed by State Street Global Advisors Singapore Limited, one of the largest fund management firms in the world. State Street Corporation can trace its history back to 1792 and has over US$4.1 trillion of assets under management. Nikko AM STI ETF is managed by Nikko Asset Management Asia Limited, one of the largest asset managers in Asia. Nikko Asset Management has over US$186.2 billion of assets under management, and was founded in 1959. In this regard, both can be said to be equally matched as they are managed by highly reputable and stable fund management firms. #2 Track Record The SPDR STI ETF was listed on the SGX on 17 April 2002, while Nikko AM STI ETF was listed on the SGX on 24 February 2009. As the SPDR STI ETF has been around longer, it has a longer track record we can rely on for information. Nevertheless, both have been around for more than 10 years to look at their past track record.

Since the SPDR STI ETF has been around longer, it has also been able to capture a larger slice of investments into the STI ETF. The SPDR STI ETF has $1.552 billion under management, while the Nikko AM STI ETF has $736.54 million under management. #4 Performance The performance of an ETF is usually based on how closely its returns are able to track the index it is trying to replicate. This also means that it will almost always underperform the market, as it charges a management fee and incurs trading costs while trying to match the benchmark returns. The SPDR STI ETF delivered a 1-year annualised return of 3.57% (as at March 2024). In the past five years, the SPDR STI ETF has delivered an annualised return of 3.85%. The Nikko AM STI ETF delivered a 1-year annualised return of 3.63% (as at March 2024). In the past five years, the Nikko AM STI ETF delivered an annualised return of 3.79%. Comparatively, the Straits Times Index delivered a 1-year return of 11.36% over the same period and a 5-year annualised return of 5.25%. Source: Nikko AM, State Street Global Advisors As you can see, both the STI ETFs achieved a slightly lower return compared to the benchmark STI. The Nikko AM STI ETF managed to deliver a slightly better 1-year and 5-year performance. Nevertheless, the difference between the two is not big. #5 Expense Ratio The total expense ratio (TER) measures how much of a fund’s assets are used for its operations, including for administrative and miscellaneous reasons. The biggest component of a fund’s expense ratio is typically its fund management fees. Obviously, the lower the expense ratio, the better it is for investors. Both the SPDR STI ETF and the Nikko AM STI ETF have an expense ratio of 0.3% per annum. While both STI ETFs technically charge the same amount, SPDR is actually receiving more money because of its larger assets under management (AUM). #6 Tracking Error If we ignore management fees, performing worse off than the market is always frowned upon. However, for ETFs, performing significantly better than the index is also not viewed as a positive thing. This is because its job is to replicate the market returns as closely as possible. The difference in replicating the market returns is usually referred to as tracking error. The SPDR STI ETF has a rolling 1-year tracking error of 0.2051% (as at 1 March 2024), while the Nikko AM STI ETF has a 3-year annualised tracking error of 0.12% (as at 31 March 2024). The Nikko AM STI ETF seems to have a slightly lower tracking error. However, the way the two STI ETFs report it is different. SPDR STI ETF reports a 1-year rolling tracking error, while the Nikko AM STI ETF reports a 3-year annualised tracking error. One possible explanation is that the tracking error may be smoothened out over a longer period. #7 Dividend The component stocks within the Straits Times Index (STI) usually pay out dividends. In fact, Singapore stocks are known to pay some of the best dividends across Asia. These dividends will be paid to the respective ETF, which will subsequently pay out these dividends to its investors. Both SPDR STI ETF and Nikko AM STI ETF have a distribution policy of paying out dividends semi-annually. This means that the ETFs do not pay out dividends immediately after receiving them from the underlying investments. Instead, both STI ETFs hold on to the dividends, and pay it out at regular intervals. According to the SGX ETF Screener, SPDR STI ETF has a dividend yield of 4.5%, while the Nikko AM STI ETF has a dividend yield of 4.37%.

For beginner investors, it offers a safe way to get started even without much investing knowledge or experience. We also don’t have to monitor our investments too closely, and can embark on a passive investing strategy, as our portfolio is instantly diversified with the 30 strongest stocks listed in Singapore. Of course, we can use this as a springboard to learning more about investing, and eventually setting aside a portion of our portfolio to invest in individual stocks in Singapore and even outside of Singapore. Moreover, indexes are also regularly reviewed and adjusted, and any changes made to the index will be replicated by our fund managers. As fund managers are just replicating the adjustments made to indexes, their fund management fees are typically much lower than actively managed funds. For experienced investors, it can be used as a great complementary passive investment strategy to diversify our risk, even as we take on riskier investments in the market.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING How Does An Election Year Affect The Country’s Stock Market? Election results don’t usually affect stock market performance. by 2024 is poised to be a monumental election year, with major elections scheduled not only in the United States and the United Kingdom but also in India, among other nations globally. Elections often herald a period of change and uncertainty. They can inspire renewed optimism as people anticipate potential improvements; however, they also raise doubts and fears about the future, especially regarding whether these changes will yield positive outcomes. Investors, in particular, face a period of heightened anxiety as they consider the potential impacts of these political shifts on their portfolios. A significant concern is how elections influence stock markets. US Elections & Stock Market Performance Research indicates that the period leading up to elections tends to be marked by volatility in the stock market, as investors exercise caution while assessing the potential impact of policy changes that new administrations might bring. Historically speaking, the S&P 500 often records slightly lower returns in election years than in non-election years. This trend suggests that political transitions’ uncertainty can affect market dynamics, leading investors to adopt a more conservative approach as they navigate the unpredictability of election outcomes and their subsequent effects on economic policies.  Source: JP Morgan Market fluctuations are regular occurrences, but election years can intensify volatility, particularly as voting day approaches. During tightly contested elections, investor caution can lead to more pronounced market dips as participants brace for possible shifts in policy that could affect their holdings. However, once election results are confirmed, and the cloud of uncertainty dissipates, the stock market often experiences a rebound. Historical data from the past 40 years supports this pattern: on average, the market has typically shown an uptrend one year after Election Day. This trend is evident when examining the purple line on the accompanying chart, which illustrates that while stocks tend to be volatile in the lead-up to the election, they generally rally once the outcome is clear. The market stabilizes with the resolution of political uncertainties. This cyclical recovery highlights how, despite initial hesitations, the market’s long-term trajectory post-election tends to skew positively.  Source: JP Morgan Beyond 12 months, data suggests that the party affiliation of the elected president—whether Republican or Democrat—does not significantly influence long-term stock market returns. According to analysis by Fisher Investments, stock market gains have been recorded regardless of which political party controls the presidency. A historical review of stock performance from January 1925 to December 2023 illustrates this point. During times when a Democratic president was in office, U.S. stocks averaged an annual return of 15.4%. Conversely, under Republican administrations, the average annual return was 9.0%. Both figures indicate positive trends regardless of the governing party. The variation in returns between the two is often attributed more to broader economic and market conditions that are largely outside the direct influence of any particular president. This data underscores a crucial insight for investors: despite the political party in power, maintaining a long-term investment in stocks has historically yielded significant returns. This suggests that market fundamentals and broader economic factors tend to play a more pivotal role in influencing returns over extended periods than the political landscape.  Source: Fisher Investments Beyond The US Similar patterns of market behaviour observed during election periods in the United States might also apply to other major countries that undergo elections, such as the UK and India. Although elections are significant events that capture extensive media attention and typically induce short-term market volatility, they are not usually the primary determinants of long-term market performance. Instead, the fundamental economic drivers, such as interest rates, inflation, and corporate earnings, play a more significant role in shaping the long-term trajectory of the stock market. These factors are crucial because they directly affect the cost of borrowing, the purchasing power of consumers, and the profitability of companies, all of which are integral to sustained economic growth. A robust underlying economy, characterised by stable or growing interest rates, controlled inflation, and strong corporate earnings, is more likely to lead to a healthy stock market. This holds true regardless of the political party or leader in office. Essentially, while political landscapes can influence market sentiments and cause fluctuations in the short term, it is the economic fundamentals that ultimately determine market stability and growth over the long haul. Have A Long-Term Perspective As investors, we should zoom out and always look far ahead into the future. Decades of data suggest that who gets elected has minimal impact on overall stock market returns over the long haul. As famed investor Warren Buffett once said: “Over the long term, the stock market news will be good. In the 20th century, the United States endured two world wars and other traumatic and expensive military conflicts; the Depression; a dozen or so recessions and financial panics; oil shocks; a flu epidemic; and the resignation of a disgraced president. Yet the Dow rose from 66 to 11,497.” Read Also: Building A Healthy Investment Portfolio: How You Also Need Discipline, Stamina and Resilience Advertiser Message Get The Latest Bite-sized Investment News, Ideas & Insights It's free!

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING 6 Investments In Singapore That Provide Guaranteed Principal And Returns If guaranteed principal and returns sound good, here are 6 types of investments that you should check out. by In a higher-for-longer interest rate environment, more people are leaning towards investments that are safer today. Moreover, financial markets can be adversely impacted by persistently high inflation and rising geopolitical uncertainties. However, there aren’t many investments that provide guaranteed principal and returns in Singapore. For certain investments that claim to pay guaranteed returns, you need to weed out the potential scams – i.e. investments that sound too good to be true. You can refer to the MAS Investor Alert List, which provides a list of unregulated persons or companies as a first layer of check. Note that if a company is not on the list, it doesn’t mean that it is automatically not a scam. One other thing to understand is that when you enjoy such safety in your investments and visibility in your investment returns, you need to be prepared to accept a slightly lower rate of return that is closer to the risk-free rate. What Is Risk-Free Returns? The risk-free return refers to a rate of return that you can expect to achieve even if you don’t take on any risk. Theoretically, there’s no such investment as there will always be some form of risk that we take on when making an investment. We look at 6 types of investments that you can put your money into which provide a guarantee on both your principal and returns. This can be a good way for those who are extremely risk-averse or unsure about investing to get started. Such investments can also act as a springboard to start investing in riskier investments as you gain knowledge and confidence. #1 Singapore Government Treasury Bills (T-Bill) Treasury bills or T-bills are the shortest-term government securities available. A good proxy for the risk-free rate in Singapore is the returns that the government of Singapore, one of the few triple-A-rated economies in the world today, pays on its 6-month or 1-year treasury bills. The latest 6-month T-bill issued in mid-April 2023 offered a cut-off yield of 3.75% per annum. The latest 1-year T-bill was offered in January 2024, and paid 3.45% – a slightly lower interest rate. Treasury bills are typically useful for investors who are looking for very short-term investments of between six months to one year, without taking on much investment risk. Read Also: Treasury Bills (T-bills): What Are They And How You Can Buy Them #2 Singapore Government Bonds  The Singapore government also issues longer-termed bonds, between 2 years and 30 years. These bonds typically pay higher returns than shorter-termed T-bills. With all things equal, a bond with a longer maturity is typically deemed to carry more risks than the same bond with a shorter maturity period. Nevertheless, it is also regarded as close to risk-free and hence offers a rate of return that is close to the risk-free rate as well. However, in the current interest rate climate, shorter-termed bonds are paying marginally higher interest returns compared to longer-dated bonds. According to the Yield Curve depicted on the MAS website, Singapore Government Bonds should be paying these rates. As you can see in the table below, the longer the bond term, the lower the yield would be – again, this is contrary to what the typical yield curve should look like. In September 2021 the government also issued the first tranche of its SINGA bonds to finance major long-term infrastructure projects, such as new railway lines, coastal protection projects and other infrastructure projects that will benefit current and future generations of Singaporeans. SINGA bonds are also considered Singapore Government Securities (SGS) bonds.  The Singapore government also launched a 50-year Green SGS bond in August 2022. These are considered as Singapore government bonds as well. #3 Singapore Savings Bonds (SSB) By now, you would have noticed a recurring theme. The safest investments that are most likely to guarantee your capital and your returns are bonds issued by the government. First launched in October 2015, the SSB pays a step-up interest rate each year, up to the 10th year. What this means is that the bonds pay a lower return in the beginning years, and if investors do not redeem the bond, it continues to pay a higher rate each year, until the 10th year. This is primarily to recognise the fact that investors are holding the bonds for a longer-term. Here is the rate of each SSB issue, if you held it for the full 10-year time frame, since its inception in October 2015.  In general, the SSB offers superior liquidity, allowing investors to redeem it at any point without worrying about its market price. This usually means that the SSB should pay out similar, but slightly lower, interest rates than comparable government securities that do not offer this feature. As depicted in the chart above, the SSB interest rate yields was on a downward trajectory since December 2018, but have since climbed strongly along with the inflation rate and Fed rate hikes. The latest SSB issue in April 2024 is offering a 10-year yield of 3.06% p.a. If you hold the SSB for only one year, you can still earn 2.99%. In the current interest rate environment, the 1-year SSB return is very close to the 10-year average return. This truly speaks to the “higher for longer” interest rate outlook.

As a reference, the three local banks in Singapore are currently offering the following Singapore-dollar fixed deposit rates.       Of course, there are many other banks offering their own fixed deposit schemes as well as promotional rates which can be significantly better than the board rates. Many of them, including the three above, may come with certain conditions you have to fulfil to achieve the promotional rates. Looking at the figures on offer, DBS is offering the best board rates on fixed deposits. It also certainly looks like OCBC’s board rates have not kept up with the other two banks. Do note that these are based on board rates, and individual banks likely offer promotional rates which may be more competitive. In addition, deposits with all full banks and finance companies in Singapore are covered under the Singapore Deposit Insurance Scheme, insuring up to $100,000 of your deposits in each account. All full banks and finance companies in Singapore, a total of 37 are listed on the SDIC website, are members of the Singapore Deposit Insurance Scheme. Read Also: Beginners’ Guide To Fixed Deposits In Singapore #5 CPF Top-Ups To earn better interest returns, you can also consider making CPF top-ups into your Special Account (SA) via the Retirement Sum Topping-Up (RSTU) Scheme. These funds are guaranteed by the Singapore government and offer a minimum guaranteed return of 4.0% p.a. Today, the Special Account interest rate has risen to 4.05%. You can also make Voluntary Contributions (VC) into your Ordinary Account, Special Account and MediSave Account. Moreover, the first $60,000 of your CPF monies, with up to $20,000 in your CPF Ordinary Account (OA), will earn an additional 1.0% p.a. in interest returns. This means your top-ups may earn up to 5.0% p.a. if you top-up your CPF SA in the early years. You also stand to receive up to $8,000 in tax reliefs when you make RSTU top-ups into your CPF SA, as well as an additional $8,000 in tax reliefs when you make cash-ups into a loved one’s CPF SA. No tax reliefs are provided when you make Voluntary Contributions to your CPF accounts. However, before you do this, you need to know that unlike the investments listed in this article, which can be sold or redeemed early (notwithstanding that you may lose some value when you do this), topping up your CPF SA is irreversible. You will only receive it once you hit 65 in the form of monthly CPF LIFE payouts, rather than in cash.

You should also note that savings plans that guarantee your capital but do not guarantee returns also exist. When investing in a savings plan, you are typically required to lock-in a lump sum investment over a fixed period or make regular contributions over a fixed period. Not adhering to the terms and conditions of these policies may see you lose a substantial amount of the returns you expected to receive. This is why you need to be sure of your liquidity needs for the funds you intend to invest. These plans are also covered by the Singapore Deposit Insurance Scheme and may also offer an insurance component that pays out in the event something unfortunate happens to you.

Riskier, but still relatively safe, investments, such as cash management accounts and/or Corporate bonds may provide a competitive return for your spare cash while still providing a high degree of liquidity. As you progress in your investing journey and understand that taking calculated risks over the long term can be financially lucrative, globally-diversified stocks portfolio, properties and other alternative investments may become investment options that can deliver significantly higher returns. This does not mean you stop being prudent with your investments. On the contrary, you need to be even more prudent when you’re embarking on riskier investments. Many of these riskier investments are volatile and require you to be able to stomach, and ride out, wild price swings at times to earn good returns over the long term.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING AutoWealth Review: Here’s What We Like About Investing With This Robo-Advisor Here’s what it’s like investing with AutoWealth. by Robo-advisory platforms, like , have become a popular way to invest in Singapore. One of the main reasons is that they integrate digital tools to provide greater convenience and simplify the investment process for investors. From the comfort of our home, we can set up our investment account, access customer support, understand our risk assessment and start investing online. Robo-advisors also develop algorithms to determine our portfolio allocation, eliminating inconsistent (and even self-serving) investment advice that human advisors may provide. These algorithms also enable us to invest in a hassle-free and passive manner. Even without much funds, investment knowledge or time to monitor our investments, we can rely on robo-advisors to help us build a globally diversified portfolio, based on our goals and risk appetite. Our portfolio will also be routinely rebalanced so it remains in line with our investment objectives. With fewer overheads, we also enjoy a lower fund management fee – growing our portfolio more efficiently. Read Also: Robo Advisors In Singapore (2024): What You Need To Know Before Investing How To Invest With AutoWealth? is an MAS-licenced robo-advisory platform that started in Singapore in 2015. As mentioned, we can open our investment account online, or choose to meet with a financial consultant if we prefer. AutoWealth Starter portfolio has a minimum investment sum of S$3,000. While not every robo-advisor has a minimum investment requirement, S$3,000 is a reasonable starting amount for young working adults. The entire process of setting up an AutoWealth account and starting an investment portfolio takes a few days. After investing with AutoWealth for a while now, here are four things we like about investing with this robo-advisor. Read Also: Robo Advisors in Singapore: What You Need To Know Before Investing #1 Straightforward Fee Structure With AutoWealth, there are only two types of charges to take note of, namely the management fee and a platform fee. The specific fee applicable depends on the type of investment products that it offers. For example, the AutoWealth Starter Portfolio, which invests in a globally diversified portfolio based on our risk level, has a 0.5% annual management fee. Whereas the AutoWealth Flexi Cash, which is a cash management account, has a low 0.1% annual management fee. These rates are applied to our portfolios regardless of our investment size. This clear structure ensures we do not have to worry about meeting a certain investment amount to enjoy preferential rates. Hence, it allows us to focus on growing our portfolio at our own pace. The other fee that we may incur is the platform fee of US$18 per year. However, it is only charged for the AutoWealth Starter portfolio. The platform fee is meant to cover all custody and transaction fees incurred in managing our investments instead of charging us per transaction. In other words, it gives us clear visibility of our transaction costs, regardless of how many times we rebalance our portfolio in a year. Read Also: Complete Cost Guide To Robo-Advisor Fees For Singapore Investors #2 Ability To Set Up A Regular Investment Plan AutoWealth investors can opt to set up a recurring monthly or quarterly investment plan. This is similar to a regular shares savings plan that allows you to invest from as little as $100 a month. The process of setting up a recurring monthly investment plan is fairly straightforward. It involves setting up a standing instruction to transfer a regular sum of money from our bank account into our AutoWealth account each month. This is where the USD18 platform fee is reassuring. As we add to our portfolio every month, we don’t have to worry about incurring additional fees each time money is transferred into our account or when our portfolio is rebalanced.

In addition, we can simply log in to our account anytime (24/7) to check on the current status and performance of our investments. AutoWealth also assigns us an actual human Wealth Manager who will contact us shortly after opening our investment portfolio. While robo-advisors are meant to eliminate the component of human emotions when handling investments, it can be reassuring to have a human touchpoint whenever we require it. We can reach out to this person via WhatsApp if we have any queries or issues with our account. #4 User-Friendly Platform  The AutoWealth platform is user-friendly and easy-to-navigate. Besides providing an overview of our portfolio’s performance, we also get detailed information on our investment portfolio and how it’s doing. Some of the things we can take a look at within our platform include: The platform also offers flexibility to make adjustments. We can adjust our goals, portfolio risk level and regular investment plan anytime. We can also choose to withdraw funds should the need arises.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg BRANDED CONTENT Why Investing Has Always Been A Marathon, Not A Sprint Run further, not faster. by This article is sponsored by FSMOne. All views expressed in this article are the independent opinion of DollarsAndSense.sg based on our research. DollarsAndSense.sg is not liable for any financial losses that may arise from any transactions and readers are encouraged to do their own due diligence. You can view our full editorial policy here. For those of us who run regularly, there are different motivations behind why we run. For some, it could be due to medical advice given to us to lower our weight and keep our bodies active. For others, it could be for aesthetic reasons, as we want to look good. Or for a few, it could be that we simply enjoy the runs as it gives us the time to relax our minds. Similarly, we all start our investing journey for different reasons. For some, it could be the goal of early retirement. For others, it could be the desire to build a secondary revenue stream so that we are no longer reliant on our employment income. And for a handful, it could be that we simply enjoy understanding the markets and being able to make profits from our investments. Regardless of our reasons for wanting to invest, we should always think of our investment journey as a long-term marathon and not a short-term sprint. Avoid Starting Too Fast In A Race It’s always thrilling to be ahead of others. Yet, as the story of the Tortoise and The Hare by Aesop taught us, it’s not that important to be starting fast. Rather, what is more important is how we finish the race. This principle applies to our investment journey as well. When we start our investment journey, it’s okay to go slow. In fact, we would even say it makes sense to start slowly. This is because when we are new and less experienced, we tend to make more mistakes. Instead of investing a large sum of money at the start (i.e., starting fast), it would be more strategic to invest a smaller sum of money initially and start building our investment knowledge before committing more. Starting slow allows us to gain valuable experience and understanding of the market dynamics. It provides an opportunity to learn from any initial mistakes without risking significant capital. By gradually increasing our investment as our knowledge grows, we can make more informed decisions and potentially avoid costly errors. In essence, the emphasis should not be on how quickly we enter the investment arena but on the consistency and wisdom with which we navigate the journey. Taking the time to build a solid foundation in investment knowledge can contribute to a more successful and sustainable long-term investment strategy. Learn To Run At Our Own Pace The most important aspect of running a marathon well is learning how to run at our own comfortable pace. If we run too quickly, we run the risk of overexerting ourselves, which may lead to early-race fatigue that would undermine our performance. It may even cause us to quit the race prematurely. Similarly, in our investment journey, it’s crucial to avoid getting worried about what the people around us are doing. Instead, we should focus on how we want to invest wisely for ourselves. This involves understanding various investment approaches, learning important concepts such as diversification and asset allocation, and implementing them in our investments. Much like a runner who paces himself well, a successful investor also needs to be disciplined in how they invest. Being an emotional investor is rarely an advantage. It’s important to avoid getting greedy, like everyone else, when the markets are performing well, or to be overly fearful when markets are underperforming. Remember, the goal is to be a successful investor in the long term, not just in the short run. Discipline in investing involves sticking to a well-thought-out investment strategy even when faced with market fluctuations. This could mean rebalancing a portfolio, staying committed to a long-term plan, and avoiding impulsive decisions based on short-term market trends or based on what our friends or social media say we should invest in. By maintaining a disciplined approach, investors increase their chances of achieving their financial goals over the long term. Challenges Are Part Of The Investment Journey Just because we choose to run at our own pace doesn’t mean that the race is going to be a simple, smooth-sailing one. As any runner would tell you, there would be difficult periods during the race where we may experience challenges including cramps, tiredness and mental fatigue. Instead of feeling discouraged because of these challenges, we should recognise that such fatigue is a normal part of a marathon, and even though we may be tired, it’s still possible to push through. This resilience is, in fact, a crucial aspect of achieving success in the long-run. Our investment journey will offer us a similar experience. As experienced investors already know, financial markets are far from smooth-sailing. It would be sensible to acknowledge that we are going to experience both the ups and downs of the market and formulate an investment strategy that can build up our portfolios across both good and bad times. For example, in the past four years alone, we have experienced the COVID-19 pandemic, high inflation and interest rates, wars on multiple fronts, and geopolitical tensions across the world. However, if you had decided not to invest due to all these uncertainties, you would have missed out on a 42% growth based on the S&P 500, growing from 3,234 on January 3, 2020, to 4,604 on December 8, 2023, which is an average of about 10% per year. The analogy that I want to draw here is that just as a runner faces challenges during a marathon but can still reach the finish line with perseverance, investors can navigate through market uncertainties and fluctuations by staying committed to a well-thought-out investment strategy. Get Rehydrated & Recharged Regularly A marathon is a long race, and while we can do all we possibly can to prepare before the race—such as carb loading, ensuring a good night’s rest, and staying well-hydrated—that is still not enough to carry us through the entire race. This is why there are regular water points during the marathon where runners can rehydrate themselves with isotonic drinks and water. Additionally, they can consume energy gels and bananas to refuel themselves, replenishing the energy they expend during the run. Similarly, in our investment journey, it’s essential to recognise the need for regular recharging. Just as marathon runners strategically replenish their energy reserves at designated points, investors should proactively engage in activities that recharge their financial knowledge, and enhance their financial acumen. One crucial aspect is consistently learning to improve our investment knowledge. Staying informed about market trends, financial instruments, and evolving investment strategies is akin to the runner’s pit stop for hydration. This ongoing learning process equips investors with the insights and skills needed to navigate the ever-changing landscape of the financial markets.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING Stocks, Bonds Or Properties? The Pros & Cons For Each Type Of Investment For Regular Income Stream The key is to understand your risk tolerance and investment horizon. by We all have dreamt of reaching the point where your passive income exceeds expenses, allowing you to live purely off your returns and thus reach the holy grail of financial independence.  In this article, we will discuss the pros and cons of three popular choices for building up a regular income stream: stocks, bonds, and properties. Stocks – Dividend Stocks And Growth Stocks Generally, there are two main types of stocks to consider: dividend stocks and growth stocks. Both offer unique advantages and disadvantages. Dividend Stocks Dividend stocks are stocks of companies that pay a portion of their profits back to shareholders in the form of dividends. These dividends can provide a steady source of income to investors, making them a popular choice for those looking for reliable cash flow. Some popular dividend stocks include the three local Singapore banks, as shown below: Source: Syfe For further research, you may use tools such as Tipranks or Dividend.com to compare yield. Pros of Dividend Stocks Dividend stocks are often issued by well-established companies with a history of stable earnings and dividends. This makes them a more stable investment option compared to growth stocks, which can be more volatile. Additionally, even though dividend stocks are generally considered to be a more conservative investment option, many dividend-paying companies also have the potential for long-term growth. This can provide investors with both income and capital appreciation over time. Read Also: Guide To Dividend Investing In Singapore Cons of Dividend Stocks While dividend stocks can provide a source of income, they may not offer the same potential for growth as growth stocks and may have limited growth potential. This is because companies that pay dividends often have mature business models that may not be expanding at the same rate as younger, more innovative companies. Additionally, because dividend stocks are often considered to be more stable than growth stocks, they can be particularly vulnerable to changes in interest rates. If interest rates rise, investors may shift their money to other investments with higher yields, causing the value of dividend stocks to decline. Note: Higher Yields Do Not Equate To Better Investments One of the key points to note for dividend investing is that stocks with higher dividend yields do not necessarily equate to a better investment option for dividend investors.  In fact, purely investing in the highest yield stocks may actually be dangerous. This is because a company could hypothetically pay a really high dividend, but if the share prices drop significantly, the actual dividend yield may end up being low.  Additionally, whilst dividend income in Singapore stocks are tax-exempted, non-US tax residents will be charged a 30% withholding tax for dividend income on US stocks. For further information such as the key financial ratios to look out for, you can read our Guide to Dividend Investing. Growth Stocks Growth stocks are stocks of companies that have the potential for high growth, either because they are in early stages of development and may not yet be profitable, or they are in an industry that is growing at a rapid pace. Whilst technically the ownership of growth stocks does not provide a passive income per se, one can periodically sell off shares to fund expenses and thereby receive “passive income”.  Pros of Growth Stocks The primary advantage of growth stocks is that they offer the potential for high growth. This can provide investors with significant capital appreciation over time, making growth stocks an attractive option for those looking to grow their wealth. These stocks are often issued by young, innovative companies that are disrupting their industries. Investing in these companies can be exciting, as they often have the potential to revolutionize their respective fields. Cons of Growth Stocks Growth stocks are often more volatile than dividend stocks, as their value is tied to the company’s growth potential rather than its established earnings history. These companies are more likely to be vulnerable to changes in the market or unexpected setbacks, and their stock prices could potentially plunge in times of distress.  Bonds – Government And Corporation Bonds Bonds are a type of debt security that represents a loan made by an investor to a borrower, usually a government or corporation.  In exchange for the loan, the borrower pays interest to the investor. Bonds are considered a safer investment option compared to stocks, but they typically offer lower returns. Some examples of bonds are government bonds (e.g. Singapore Government Securities), corporate bonds, and treasury bonds.  One popular investment strategy for holding bonds is to consider the 60/40 portfolio, which refers to allocating 60% of one’s portfolio to large-cap equities and 40% to bonds like treasuries or investment-grade corporate bonds. This will provide your portfolio with a mix of both worlds: the high growth of stocks, and the safety of bonds. When considering bonds, you may also consider fixed deposits, which offer higher returns than savings accounts whilst also being virtually risk-free. However, do note that in general, bonds may still provide higher yield than fixed deposits. Top bonds to buy as of Apr 2023/ Source: Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, and company websites: Banks with best fixed deposit interest rates/ Source: Dollars And Sense Pros of Bonds Bonds are considered a safer investment option compared to stocks. They are backed by the borrower’s ability to repay the loan, and in the case of government bonds, they are considered to be virtually risk-free. Bonds also provide a regular income stream through interest payments. This can be a reliable source of income for investors who are looking for steady returns. Overall, investing in bonds helps to mitigate the risk of a single bond defaulting, as it allows for diversification across different issuers and maturities. Cons of Bonds Bonds typically offer lower returns compared to stocks, as they are considered to be a safer investment option. The Singapore 10Y government bond yield for example has been hovering between 1.5% to around 3% recently. Additionally, there is typically a lockup period ranging from 6 months to a few years, and early withdrawal would incur a penalty. This makes bonds and fixed deposits more illiquid than stocks. Read Also: Core, Value-Add & Opportunistic Investment: How Different Property Investment Strategies Determine The Ideal Properties To Invest In Properties – Rental Income And Capital Appreciation The two main ways one can earn a regular income through property are rental income and capital appreciation, and there are endless strategies for how you can achieve this.  Some examples include: 1) Renting out a room in your homestay property  2) Buying two properties and staying in one whilst renting out / flipping the other  3) Venturing into commercial and industrial properties if your family already has properties under your names and you do not wish to incur Additional Buyer Stamp Duty (ABSD). Pros of Properties Not only could you receive regular rental income for the duration of the lease period, there is also potential for capital appreciation on the property itself. Overall, Singapore house prices grew by an average of 4.8% from 1976 to 2022.  Singapore resale non-landed property price index/ Source: SRX Singapore resale HDB property price index/ Source: SRX For those venturing into commercial or industrial properties, no ABSD will be incurred for owning multiple commercial or industrial properties. Additionally, Seller’s Stamp Duty (SSD) is not applicable for commercial properties. However, SSD is applicable for Industrial Properties that are sold before the holding period of 3 years ends. Cons of Properties If you are going for private residential property, the initial down payment would be expensive, especially as the cash portion needs to be at least 10% and the total down payment portion is 25%.  Additionally, one would be unable to sell a property before 3 years without incurring the Seller’s Stamp Duty. The buying and selling process is slow as well, often taking months to complete.  For commercial or industrial properties, the property tax is a flat 10%, which is higher than residential property tax in some cases. In addition, unlike capital gains which are not taxed in Singapore, rental income is taxed.  Owning a property also requires ongoing maintenance and management. As a landlord, this also involves searching for tenants once a tenant’s lease has expired, and there may be loss of rental income between tenant leases. Lastly, for commercial and industrial properties, knowledge of the industry becomes even more important for understanding whether or not the property is a good investment or if it is able to provide good rental yield. Without the right knowledge, one could potentially make an expensive mistake. Another Option That’s Possibly The Best of All Worlds: Funds A cheat code of sorts would be to invest in funds, allowing you to enjoy the returns of the instrument whilst reducing risk by being diversified, all whilst requiring lower upfront capital than buying one lot of shares or owning a property. Be it stocks, bonds, properties, or REITs, there is no lack of funds for each category. Basically a fund is a pool of money managed by a professional investment manager, often with a theme such as “tech stocks”, and holding anywhere from 50 to 200 stock positions, or even more. There are two main types of funds, mutual funds and ETFs. In short, the key difference between the two are that ETFs generally track an index and require less management (and thereby less fees), whilst mutual funds aim to outperform the market with more active management (thereby incurring higher fees). Though funds are generally perceived as safer than stocks, they can sometimes show returns as high as stocks themselves.  Source: Phillip Capital However, do remember the age-old wisdom that the past performance is not an indicator of future performance. In fact, the gold standard for funds, the S&P 500, outperformed every single actively managed fund in the past five years, according to the NY Times. The S&P has provided an annualized average return of around 11.88% from inception (1957) to 2022. Pros of Funds Funds are more diversified than buying individual stocks, which can help to reduce risk and provide a steady income stream. Professional fund managers have years of experience and expertise in the investment industry, and can help to manage and in certain cases rebalance the portfolio. Cons of Funds Funds charge fees for management and other expenses, which can eat into your returns. In fact, due to the fact that in the long run most actively managed funds are unable to beat the S&P 500, studies have shown that the lower the fees, the better the return on investment. Funds with lower costs have outperformed more expensive ones/ Source: Vanguard The reason higher-cost funds generally underperform lower-cost funds is because the fund managers charging these costs have a difficult time adding enough value to overcome the additional expense. Even if fees seem small, when compounded over 20 years, there could be a major impact on your portfolio returns. The impact of small fees on portfolio returns could be significant when compounded over 20 years/ Source: US Securities and Exchange Commission Churning, turnover, and window dressing may happen if your manager is abusing their authority too. This includes unnecessary trading, excessive replacement, and selling the losers prior to quarter-end to fix the books. Another reason is that investors have lack of control or limited control over the investments made by the fund manager, which means that they may not agree with all investment choices. The Verdict: Find The Investment Type That Is Best Suited For You And Your Needs Ultimately, the choice between stocks, bonds and properties for generating a regular income stream depends on your investment goals, risk tolerance, and financial situation. Below are some factors to consider when deciding which investment option is better for generating a regular income stream. Summary of the pros and cons of each type of instrument in general: Risk Tolerance One of the most important factors to consider when building a regular income stream is your risk tolerance. Stocks and properties are generally considered riskier investments than bonds, but they also offer higher potential returns. Your risk tolerance will depend on your financial goals, investment experience, and overall financial situation. Diversification Diversification is critical when building a regular income stream. A diversified investment portfolio can help reduce risk and maximize returns. It’s important to consider investing in a mix of stocks, bonds, and properties to achieve a well-balanced portfolio.  Additionally, diversification within each asset class is also important. For example, within stocks, you may want to consider investing in a mix of large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap stocks, as well as different sectors and industries. Volatility and Regularity of Income Stream Volatility is one of the key factors in determining if you will be able to achieve a stable income stream from your portfolio. If your portfolio consists mainly of highly volatile stocks, even if the capital appreciation in the long run is high, constant fluctuations may mean that you may not be able to cash out regularly. This is why it is not advisable to depend on the returns from risky stocks to pay your mortgage or bills. Liquidity And Investment Horizon Finally, when building a regular income stream, it’s important to consider the liquidity of your investments, and how long you are willing to hold them for. Stocks would have the highest liquidity, followed by bonds and properties, both of which would incur penalties if you have to sell before maturity. Additionally, different instruments are suitable for short and long investment horizons. If you have a shorter investment horizon, you may want to consider investing in bonds and high-quality dividend stocks. If you have a longer investment horizon, you may be able to take on more risk and invest in growth stocks and properties that have the potential for higher returns over the long term. Start Investing And Be Consistent Overall, the key to building up a regular income stream is firstly and most importantly to start investing, and once you start, to consistently invest in order to dollar-cost-average any market fluctuations.  There’s never a perfect time to start investing, and as studies have shown, time in the market is more important than timing the market.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg BRANDED CONTENT US Asian Hours: 6 Things Investors Need To Know About Buying US Stocks During Singapore Market Hours You can now react faster than other market players. by This article was written in collaboration with Phillip Securities. All views expressed in this article are the independent opinion of DollarsAndSense.sg based on our research. DollarsAndSense.sg is not liable for any financial losses that may arise from any transactions and readers are encouraged to do their own due diligence. You can view our full editorial policy here. With a market capitalisation of over US$40 trillion, the US stock market offers investors access to some of the largest and most innovative businesses, giving them the best opportunities to grow their wealth over the long term. For Singapore investors, trading in the US stock market brings about greater diversification and more trading opportunities due to the higher volatility compared to the local stock market. However, higher volatility may also be viewed as carrying a higher risk. That’s where Phillip Securities’ POEMS’s US Asian Hours may help investors manage their portfolio risk by providing trading access to selected US stocks during Singapore market hours (i.e. from 9am to 5pm SGT). #1 What Is US Asian Hours A big obstacle for Singapore investors trading US stocks is dealing with the late hours in which the US stock market operates. In Singapore, this is from 9.30pm to 4am (SGT) from the second Sunday in March to the first Sunday in November, and 10.30pm to 5am for the rest of the time (to account for Non-Daylight savings). During this period, investors may also participate in the US Pre-Market from 4pm to 9.30pm (SGT). This leaves a gap between 4am to 4pm (SGT) – more specifically during the bulk of the Singapore market hours – during which Singapore investors are unable to transact their US stocks. Bridging this gap is the US Asian Hours, trading service provided by Phillip Securities’ trading platform POEMS. This newly introduced trading service allows its clients to trade US stocks during Asian hours (9am to 5pm SGT). With this service, investors have up to 20 active hours (during non-DST) of seamless US trading, from the US Asian Hours to the US Pre-Market to Regular Trading hours. Read Also: Step By Step Guide To Opening A Brokerage Account With POEMS #2 Why Trade US Stocks In Asian Hours i. Act On News Event And Earnings Announcements During Asian Market Hours News events that affect the stock market may happen at any time of the day, including outside regular trading hours. Similarly, companies may release their earnings announcements either during Pre-Market hours or after regular market hours. Having access to US Asian Hours gives you an edge, the nimbleness to react to such news events and have the first-mover advantage when acting on any market-moving events. For instance, the S&P 500 futures fell by around 3% from 2pm SGT and carried over until the US Pre-Market hours (or 9pm SGT), as shown below, following the news of the bank run on Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and uncertainty as to how it would affect the financial market. With the US Asian Hours trading service provided by Phillip Securities, investors who fear of a bigger selldown during regular US trading hours, may liquidate their positions ahead of other market participants.  ii. Gauge Market Sentiments You can use the price movements feature on the POEMS trading platform during US Asian Hours as a means to gauge the market sentiments to help you prepare for the pre-market session. iii. Profit From Arbitrage Opportunities There are two ways to identify potential arbitrage opportunities during US Asian Hours. One way is to look for opportunities during the overlap time periods between the US Asian Hours and the US Pre-Market Hours from 4pm to 5pm SGT. Assuming there is a price difference between the two markets, you can simultaneously buy and sell for an arbitrage trade. The second way is to look for opportunities in dual-listed stocks like Alibaba. For example, if there’s a price difference between the Hong Kong listing and the NYSE listing, you can make a simultaneous buy and sell for an arbitrage trade. However, there are other considerations when utilising this strategy, such as the conversion ratio of the American Depository Receipts (ADR) and the foreign exchange fees.

What To Do When The Stock Market Crashes? #3 Trade 55 US Stocks And 4 ETFs During US Asian Hours Investors would be able to trade 55 popular US-listed stocks, such as Alibaba, Apple, and Tesla, as well as 4 ETFs, like the Invesco QQQ Trust, SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, and ProShares UltraPro QQQ (3X QQQ ETF). The full list of the tradable US Asian Market Hours counters can be found on the POEMS website. #4 Minimum Trade Order Size Of US$10 When trading during US Asian Hours, the minimum trade size per order is US$10. This should not be an issue as all the stocks currently on offer trades above US$10 per share. While you can place your order via POEMS 2.0 Web or POEMS Mobile 3 App like in the regular and pre-market sessions, for US Asian Hours, you can only place one order (either a Limit or Market order) at any one time for each counter. #5 Phillip Securities Acts As The Principal For US Asian Hours Trades Phillip Securities will act as the principal or market maker for all US Asian Hours trades. This is unlike during regular Trading and US Pre-Market hours, when it acts as the agency that facilitates transactions and liquidity is fulfilled by the stock exchange. Quotes for the bid and ask, which are based on the security’s previous day’s closing, may vary between the different counters depending on the volume during the US Asian Hours. Nevertheless, the spread for widely traded counters like ProShares UltraPro QQQ and Tesla could be as low as 0.01 cents.    Source: POEMS (Screengrab as of 27 April 2023) #6 Competitive Commission Rates The standard commission rate for online trades using POEMS’ US Asian Hours trading service is 0.3% (minimum US$20) is applicable to all account types. However, from 19 July 2022 till 30 June 2023, you can trade at the promotional rate of just 0.08% (with no minimum trading fees). These trade orders must be settled in either SGD or USD within 2 days from the date of trading. Additionally, do note you also need to pay the following regular trading fees for each trade on the US Market: Separately, Cash Plus Account holders with less than $250,000 in asset value are charged an account maintenance fee (for Singapore stocks) of S$15 per quarter (based on the March, June, September, and December month-end balances). However, this fee will be waived provided you make at least one trade per quarter. As for Cash Management Account holders holding foreign shares, they will incur Foreign Share Custody Charges of S$2 per counter per month (subject to a max of S$150 per quarter). A waiver of the fees will be granted provided you make at least two trades per month or six trades per quarter or accumulate a minimum of S$132 in brokerage fees per quarter.

However, the same volatility can be a double-edged sword for investors, as it could mean taking on a bigger risk. As the first broker in Singapore to provide US Asian Hours service, Phillip Securities enables investors to react more quickly to market-moving news outside the regular trading hours and take advantage of arbitrage opportunities in dual-listed counters like Alibaba, Baidu, and Bilibili. This can help them mitigate their portfolio risks and seize new short-term opportunities before other market participants. Simply open a POEMS trading account today and have access to over 20 different markets, including the US Asian Hours. Fear no more on how the US market will open and instead revel in the edge over others to react faster and make better trading decisions. 4 STOCKS THIS WEEK Singtel (Z74); StarHub (CC3); NetLink (CJLU): Local Telcos Dividend Yield And Share Price Performance BRANDED CONTENT Cashback Vs Miles: How To Enjoy The Best Of Both Worlds MONEY Complete Guide To Multi-Currency Accounts And Wallets In Singapore [YouTrip, Revolut, Wise, DBS My Account, UOB Mighty FX And More] INSIGHTS 7 International Rankings That Singaporeans Enjoy PROPERTY En Bloc Deal: 3 Ways You Can Still Not Make Any Money COLUMNS 8 Things You Need To Know Before Heading To The Money Changer BRANDED CONTENT Why Homeowners Should Avoid Overspending on Their HDB Flats MONEY 11 Joints Savings Account To Open With Your Spouse Or Parents BONDS AND FIXED INCOME Step By Step Guide To Buying T-Bills Online Using Your CPF OA Savings ESTATE GUIDE Neighbourhood Estate Guide: Rediscovering Jurong East, The Regional Centre Of The West                     Copyright © 2019 DollarsAndSense. \n",

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING POEMS Cash Plus Account: Complete Guide To Understanding This Low Cost Trading Account Instead of needing to make large transaction to get lower brokerage rate, the POEMS Cash Plus Account allows you to enjoy lower brokerage rate based on the total asset under management. by This article was written in collaboration with POEMS by PhillipCapital. All views expressed in this article are the independent opinion of DollarsAndSense.sg based on our research. DollarsAndSense.sg is not liable for any financial losses that may arise from any transactions and readers are encouraged to do their own due diligence. You can view our full editorial policy here. Before you can start investing in the financial markets, you need to open a trading account with a brokerage. In Singapore, one such brokerage you can consider is Phillip Securities, Singapore’s largest retail broker. Operating under the PhillipCapital umbrella, Phillip Securities was the first broker in Singapore to launch an online trading platform, Phillip’s Online Electronic Mart System more commonly known as POEMS. Established since 1996, POEMS has become one of Singapore’s most popular trading platforms. When you open a trading account with Phillip Securities, you can opt for its newly launched POEMS Cash Plus Account. Besides providing access to global stock markets, POEMS Cash Plus Account also offers personalised 24/7 dealing assistance and consultation service at 15 conveniently located Phillip Investor Centres. As a proponent of investor education, PhillipCapital also offers free trading webinars, seminars and research materials on POEMS to raise financial literacy among investors and help them make informed investment decisions. Markets That You Can Trade With Low Cost POEMS Cash Plus Account Today, investors are no longer limited to just investing in companies listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX). With POEMS, you can invest in a total of 26 exchanges globally, including the United States, Hong Kong, China, Australia, Germany financial markets, or regional markets such as Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. For investors who choose the POEMS Cash Plus Account, you will be happy to know that it is one of the lowest-cost trading accounts in Singapore and the US. Charging just 0.08% of your trade value, with no minimum commission, a S$3,000 investment in Singapore stocks will only incur S$2.40 in brokerage commission fees. A flat rate of between USD 1.88 – 3.88 is charged for US stocks. This brokerage rate is applicable for investment using Central Provident Fund (CPF) and Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) money.  Source: POEMS One interesting observation about the POEMS Cash Plus Account is that it has a tiered pricing model based on the value of assets held in a custodian account with POEMS, rather than the size of each transaction. This is different from most other brokerage firms in Singapore, where you typically enjoy a lower brokerage rate when your transaction size is higher, typically at S$50,001 to S$100,000, or at S$100,000 and above. The method POEMS uses to determine your brokerage rate is more advantageous to smaller retail investors, who will find it difficult to achieve a single trade size that is above S$50,000. For example, even if you intend to invest about S$5,000 each month, and decide to save up for 6 months so that you make a one-time investment of S$30,000, you will still be unable to qualify for lower brokerage charges for investment on the next tier, which is typically at S$50,001. The POEMS Cash Plus Account bases its brokerage rate on the value of assets held under its custody, making it easier for investors to enjoy the lower brokerage rates. An investor who starts investing S$5,000 a month will qualify as a Premier customer (S$30,000 to S$249,000) after six months – and can enjoy a lower brokerage rate for all subsequent trades via the POEMS Cash Plus Account, regardless of how small they are, as long as the value of their assets held with POEMS is S$30,000 and above. To qualify as a Privileged customer, the asset under management must be at S$250,000 or more. POEMS investors can invest in a combination of stocks, bonds, money market funds or even just hold cash in their POEMS Cash Plus Account. All these are considered as assets under management, which makes it much easier for POEMS investors to qualify as a Privilege customer and enjoy the lower brokerage rate. Pay For Your Investments In Foreign Currencies Another advantage of the POEMS Cash Plus Account is that it allows you to pay in foreign currency. You enjoy both convenience and cost efficiency when trading overseas stocks. There is a total of nine foreign currencies (USD, HKD, MYR, JPY, AUD, GBP, EUR, CNY and CAD) that you can hold onto, apart from SGD. For example, if you want to invest in US-listed companies such, as Apple and Amazon, or Singapore listed companies trading in USD, such as Dairy Farm International or Manulife US REIT, you want to ensure that you are not only getting a good price for the stocks, but also a good currency exchange rate. This is because you will need to settle the trades in USD and exchange your SGD for USD. If the exchange rate is not favourable or transparent, then you may be paying more (in SGD) even if the price in USD remains the same. When the SGD to USD conversion rate is favourable to you (i.e. the SGD is strong relative to the USD), you may want to convert to USD today, even if you are not looking to invest in US-denominated stocks immediately. The POEMS Cash Plus Account allows you to maintain foreign currencies in your account. As such, you can choose to settle your purchases or sales either in foreign currency or in SGD. Earn Interest On Funds Deposited In Your POEMS Cash Plus Account If you have funds in your POEMS Cash Plus Account that are not yet invested, or receive funds in your account after selling some stocks, you don’t need to worry about money being left idle. For any amount above 50,000 held in SGD, USD and HKD, you will earn interest on credit balance up to 0.60%, find out more in POEMS Cash Plus Account Infosheet. To enjoy higher returns on your uninvested monies, you can opt for POEMS’s Excess Funds Management facility that automatically parks idle cash in your POEMS Cash Plus Account in the Phillip Money Market Fund, which can earn you interest of about 2.59% p.a. [2.5924% p.a. (SGD),3.4808% p.a. (USD) as of 17 April 2023].  Source: POEMS Whenever you invest through POEMS, funds will automatically be deducted from your holdings with Excess Funds Management facility. Do note that as with all types of investments, money market funds invested via the Excess Funds Management facility are neither risk-free nor are the advertised interest rates guaranteed since this is based on prevailing market interest rates. You can read up more about Excess Funds Management facility here, or watch a short yet informative Q&A video here. Assets Are Held In A Custodian Account Via Phillip Securities Similar to many brokerage firms in Singapore, any assets deposited or transacted through the POEMS Cash Plus Account will be held in a custodian account with Phillip Securities. The only exception is investments made using CPF/SRS monies. Your account will also be automatically credited with dividends and interest payments that you earn from your investments. One thing we like about the POEMS Cash Plus Account is that you can easily designate it as your primary investment account. Unlike some other brokers that may require you to link your brokerage account to a separate bank account, the POEMS Cash Plus Account can be used not only to make trades and to hold your shares, but also to hold any cash (in SGD or foreign currency) that you may have set aside for your investments. This way, you minimise conflating your investment returns and investment deposits from other sources of income that you may also receive (e.g. your salary). For self-directed investors, most of the services that you need can be found in the POEMS Cash Plus Account. There is a maintenance fee payable each quarter. This is at $15 per quarter for SGX stocks (waived if there is 1 trade per quarter) and $2 per counter per month for foreign shares (waived with a minimum of 2 trades per month or 6 trades per quarter or minimum of S$132 brokerage per quarter). However, for Privileged customers with $250,000 or more assets under management, account maintenance fee is automatically waived. Apply For A POEMS Cash Plus Account Besides the services that you can access via the POEMS Cash Plus Account, Phillip Securities is a full-service broker that provides its customers with research, platform tools, webinars and seminars. You can also invest beyond the stock market, into unit trusts, bonds and receive securities advisory services as well through POEMS. Account opening can be done entirely online and investors who submit their registration via Myinfo before noon can have their account opened by the next working day.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg ESG 5 Things To Know About Centurion Corporation (SGX Code: OU8), The Company Behind Purpose-Built Workers Accommodation Under The Westlite Brand Providing a safe, caring, and inclusive home away from home for its residents. by Foreign workers play an important role in our local economy, especially in the construction, marine shipyard, and process (CMP) sectors, where jobs cannot be easily filled by locals. As the COVID-19 restrictions eased in 2022, demand for foreign workers in the CMP sectors outstripped pre-pandemic levels, with 415,000 work permit holders employed as of December 2022, compared to 370,100 in December 2019, as companies rushed to complete projects that were put on hold. As a result, there is a significant demand for the roughly 439,000 beds in the 1,600 dormitories in Singapore, which are typically used to house foreign workers. This plays strongly to Centurion Corporation (SGX Code: OU8), the largest Purpose-Built Workers Accommodation provider in Singapore and Malaysia. It operates 9 PBWA in Singapore, comprising 33,898 beds, and 8 PBWA in Malaysia, comprising 26,313 beds, under the Westlite brand. Centurion also operates 17 Purpose-Built Student Accommodation (PBSA) under the dwell brand, comprising a total of 6,080 beds in major education hubs like Australia, South Korea, United Kingdom, and the United States. With demand for worker and student housing expected to remain high in 2023, here are 5 things to know about Centurion Corporation. What is Centurion’s competitive advantage over your industry peers? As a pioneer and leading provider in the workers accommodation industry, Centurion believes in continuous innovation to address evolving consumer needs and regulatory shifts, which keeps us ahead of the market. For instance, we developed our Singapore PBWA such that all apartment units have been equipped with ensuite toilets, showers and kitchen since 2011. This was before the COVID-19 outbreak, which led local authorities to specify ensuite toilets and showers as the better solution for pandemic-management. Besides structural design and build, Centurion’s philosophy of ‘Business with a Heart’ is also core to our business. Our stakeholders value our dedication, experience and expertise in delivering care and concern for our multinational and multicultural resident communities. We believe that understanding residents’ needs and ensuring quality living condition are significant factors. These include room inspections for hygiene and cleanliness, active event calendars for social inclusion and mental wellbeing, as well as addressing security and safety concerns. In terms of portfolio growth and scalability, we have established management platforms and processes, agency and partner relationships, technology platforms and tools as well as talent development programmes. This enables us to quickly replicate operating capabilities into new markets and properties, with optimal ramp-up periods. Interest rates are expected to stay elevated for the next two years. What impact does this have on the Group’s businesses and how is it managing this risk? We have, over the past years, prudently pared down our leverage, from a Net Gearing Ratio of 51% as at 31 Dec 2019, to 43% as at 31 Dec 2022.  This has helped to moderate the impact of rising interest rates. At the same time, we continue to monitor and manage the risks.  We have a long-term bank debt maturity profile of 6 years, and our interest cover is healthy at 3.9x.  We have also hedged our interest rates risks, where relevant and appropriate.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING Five Big Investing Questions For 2023 Commentators see a shallow recession, or soft landing, as likely this year. by This article was contributed to us by Jamie Lee, Head of Financial Planning and Editorial at Endowus. As we kick off the new year, investors may be thinking about what will shape their investing journey in 2023. Here are five big investing themes that may dominate the year. Have We Hit Peak Inflation? In 2023, the focus on inflation will remain — specifically on whether US inflation has peaked, with November’s core Consumer Price Index (CPI) making its smallest advance in 15 months. (Core CPI strips out energy and food prices due to their volatility.) This attention to the surging consumer prices in the world’s largest economy comes because the Fed has been aggressively hiking interest rates to fend off runaway inflation. In 2022, the Fed made seven rate hikes, bringing the benchmark fed funds rate to a range of between 4.25% and 4.5% — a 15-year high. It is the most aggressive Fed rate-hike cycle in more than 40 years. Interest rates reflect the cost of capital — from an economic perspective, when credit becomes more expensive, this engineers a slowdown in growth and can cause job losses, which also cools consumer demand. From an investor’s point of view, it changes how stocks and bonds are valued with the sudden surge in the cost of capital — albeit from a long period of low rates. The concern is how destabilising the sudden jump in debt burden will be on asset prices. As it is, growth stocks were stung in 2022 as investors reassessed their lofty valuations, with tech firms missing earnings projections and investors turning impatient with loss-making counters. At the Fed’s final meeting of 2022, policymakers agreed to raise the central bank’s key interest rate by 0.5 percentage point — a smaller increase than the 0.75 percentage-point hikes seen at the previous four straight meetings. But hopes of a less aggressive Fed were dashed as the Fed chair Jerome Powell signalled a more aggressive rate hike path than what investors were hoping for in 2023. Some commentators suggest that the Fed may now be overshooting on inflationary expectations, after undershooting on the previously held belief that inflation was transitory. At this point, there are two tracks when it comes to looking at inflation. While goods inflation (houses, cars, capital goods) has come off significantly in the later part of 2022, inflation in the services sector remains stubborn, as people continue on their revenge travel and spend more at restaurants and concerts after some two years of Covid-prompted social distancing. A lot of attention falls on how much US unemployment will need to rise to let out some wage-inflation pressure. PIMCO points out that the post-pandemic labour market has changed in fundamental and complex ways: “There has to be a great deal of uncertainty as we enter 2023 about how much adjustment in the labour market will ultimately be required to reduce wage inflation to a pace consistent with price stability.” In its investment outlook for 2023, BlackRock sees central banks eventually backing off from rate hikes as the economic damage becomes reality. That said, while inflation will cool, it will stay persistently higher than central bank targets of 2%, it adds. There are three main reasons for this: Against this backdrop, BlackRock notes that investors need to come to terms with a new investing playbook. “Central bankers won’t ride to the rescue when growth slows in this new regime, contrary to what investors have come to expect,” it says. In fact, they are deliberately engineering recessions by overtightening policy. “That makes a recession foretold.” Which brings us to the next question — how painful will this impending recession be? Read Also: The Stock Market Has Crashed 20%. Here’s 5 Things Investors Can Do In A Bear Market Recession: A Soft Landing? Fidelity sees a shallow recession as likely. The view is that the US Fed tightening would push the economy into a cyclical recession, but an eventual pivot by central banks combined with stronger balance-sheet positions in developed markets could cushion the shock, preventing a severe downturn. Similarly, JPMorgan Asset Management’s core scenario sees developed economies falling into a mild recession in 2023. Its view is that far more expensive mortgage rates will crimp new housing demand, with the impact felt through the global economy in 2023. This means weakening construction activity, and less spending on furniture and other household durables. The wealth impact from falling house prices could also weigh on consumer spending for the next few quarters. Taken together, these should have the intended effect of taming inflation. The impact should also come without a deep and painful economic contraction (as was seen in the Global Financial Crisis, or GFC). There is less of a supply glut this time round, as seen in the chart below detailing the situation in the US and UK. Global regulators — including those in Singapore — have also tightened borrowing rules to ensure prudence by borrowers. Bonds Are Back; Will It Vindicate A 60/40 Balance? For the first time in a long while, investors are getting excited about bonds. To be sure, the bond market went through a shock, given the fastest pace of rate hikes seen in modern times. For the first time in 45 years, both stocks and bonds fell in tandem in a calendar year, in 2022. But as a research note from Schwab points out, the bond market today is now offering attractive yields not seen in years. With most of the Fed’s rate hikes behind investors, and with inflation likely to fall, yields in fixed-income solutions are today above dividend yields. And with risk-free government bonds offering stronger yields, investors can soak up more income for less risk. Given recession fears, high-quality fixed income does well in this scenario, says Capital Group. While rising rates have caused bond prices to fall, this also means yields are rising. Particularly for holders of bond funds, income should increase; once the bonds in the funds mature, the funds are reinvested by bond managers into fixed income with higher yields.

While investors may wonder if tactical shifts would make more sense in this environment, the fund manager notes that over the long term, the balanced portfolio is likely to outperform a market timing strategy that tries to switch between equities and bonds — even before accounting for transaction costs. To illustrate this, Eastspring calculated what would happen if an investor tried to time the market every month between 1992 and 2022 — meaning a full switch between equities and bonds. At the end of 30 years, the market timing strategy would have ended up below the 60/40 portfolio in 58% of the cases. This comes before any transaction cost, which can, in reality, be substantial. If a modest transaction cost of 0.1% of the value of each trade is included, then the 60/40 portfolio would have beaten the market timing strategy 90% of the time over the course of 30 years. “As the historical bond and equity relationships are being re-asserted following the market corrections this year, the stage is set for the balanced portfolio to deliver the long-term returns that investors desire, with the volatility that they are comfortable with,” Eastspring concludes. “It is too premature to call for its demise.” Still Bearish On Stocks Till Earnings Adjust? Allianz Global Investors’ (AllianzGI) 2023 investment outlook notes that corporate earnings expectations still need to adjust downwards — possibly by a large margin in some cases — as they have not yet fully priced in the recessionary environment, rising inventories, input costs and rates, as well as a stronger greenback. “Expectations need to adjust to a world in which money has a cost again,” it adds. “Growth can no longer be funded with limitless debt, and the threshold for the return on capital employed must rise. Ultimately, this development is healthy and may promote the survival of the fittest, favour quality companies and balance sheets, and boost income for some.” Commentators therefore will be looking to the upcoming earnings season, with listed companies due to report their 2023 guidance in the first quarter of the year. Morgan Stanley expects the emerging markets to be early to the recovery on cheap valuations and a typical recovery before the US markets — if the previous economic cycles offer a guide. Will The Alternatives Rock On? The Nirvana reference goes beyond a riff on the term “alternatives”. Music from the band synonymous with the grunge movement is also owned in part by a private equity (PE) group. More PE firms have in recent times snapped up music royalties of top acts such as Red Hot Chili Peppers, Justin Bieber, and Taylor Swift (much to her chagrin). PE joins hedge funds, private credit, and other forms of alternative investments as a touted way to add diversity to one’s investment portfolio. This is particularly so for those who believe the balanced portfolio no longer offers diversification benefits. In its outlook, Apollo says that investors who were stung by a poor performance from their 60/40 portfolios of public equities and bonds in 2022 are likely to turn to private markets in 2023. “Purchase price matters and we see a historic entry point in private credit and attractive opportunities in private equity for investors able to be providers of capital in a time of stressed and distressed markets.” PE proved particularly resilient during the GFC, noted by some as the first real test for the investment class. Data from Preqin shows that the S&P 500 was hit by a maximum drawdown of some 40% between 2008 and 2009. PE, however, was down by just 26.6%, as measured by the Preqin Private Equity Quarterly Index (PrEQIn). That said, Preqin points out that the circumstances of the market today reflect different pressures, specifically with inflation and rising rates — this is an unprecedented test for the asset class. Global macro hedge funds in 2022 also had a blowout year, making trades off swiftly shifting rates and currency moves. But selection matters: the biggest gap between the best and poorest performers (by top and bottom deciles) since the GFC was also recorded in 2022.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING How To Start Investing With Just $100 A Month In Singapore It is a myth that you need a large sum of money to start investing. Here is how you can grow your money today. by When you are new to investing, it’s easy to be intimidated by having to commit actual money into investments. Stories of other people losing large sums of money due to poor investment decisions, or not being confident of one’s own knowledge, can quickly paralyse many people from taking the first important step in starting their investment journey. Some may even put off investing altogether, thinking that they do not have enough savings to start. Yet, the same people have no qualms about spending $100 or more on a single meal at a restaurant, even though they could use the same amount to begin their investing journey. Starting Your Investment Journey May Not Require As Much Money And Knowledge As You Originally Thought Setting aside a large sum of money and acquiring extensive knowledge before you actually start investing is not only unnecessary and impractical, it may not even be the ideal situation. One way of understanding this is to see investing as similar to learning life skills such as how to swim or cook, or even work. You don’t learn how to swim by doing so on dry ground or cook just by thinking about it. You still have to jump into the swimming pool, or physically taste the spices. New investors shouldn’t think of making a large sum of money when they first start investing. Instead, they should start small, and aim to learn and figure things out along the way. Of course, nobody is saying you should start by jumping into the ocean to learn to swim, or volunteer to cook for a party of 50 when you’re cooking for the first time. By starting small and slow, you will gradually build up the momentum, confidence and ability to swim in the ocean or cook for a party. By investing a small amount regularly, you put into motion a conscientious plan to be interested in where your money is being invested on a regular basis. As you become more knowledgeable and confident, you can slowly increase the amount you invest. Can I Start With Just $100 A Month? Obviously, setting aside this amount is not going to enable you to own landed property or become a millionaire within a few years. However, it does give you several options to begin your investment journey. The strategy of investing a small, fixed sum on a regular schedule is also known as dollar-cost averaging. In this case, the fixed amount you invest each month automatically allows you to buy more units of shares when market prices are low, and fewer units of shares when prices are high. Here are some practical options available for the beginner investor: Read Also: Active Investing VS Passive Investing, Lump Sum VS Dollar Cost Averaging: Which Investment Strategy Suits You Best? Option 1: Regular Shares Savings Regular Shares Savings (RSS) plans, also known as monthly investment plans, are one way to get started on investing into stocks on the Singapore Exchange (SGX). You can start from as little as $100 a month. Getting started is easy. You just need to open an RSS plan with one of the four brokerage firms/banks in Singapore that offer it. #1 OCBC Blue Chip Investment Plan #2 DBS/POSB Invest-Saver #3 Phillip Share Builders Plan #4 FSMOne ETF Regular Savings Plan Here’s how this works: The broker you use will invest a fixed amount each month based on your instructions. For example, you can choose to invest $100 each month into a Straits Times Index (STI) Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). The best part about RSS plans is that you have full control over your investment decisions. If you wish to invest in different companies each month, increase your investments, or stop investing, you can simply change your instructions with the brokerage firm. These can be done at your convenience through the online brokerage platform that you are using. Read Also: Step-By-Step Guide to Stock Investing in Singapore Option 2: Robo-Advisors Robo-advisors are platforms that automatically help users invest by tapping on algorithms (formulas) to manage and allocate the assets in their portfolio. While robo-advisors, in general, have already been around for some time, they are relatively new in Singapore. In Singapore, there are now a number of robo-advisors on the scene, joining pioneers like StashAway and AutoWealth. Each robo-advisor uses a different methodology to determine an optimal investment allocation. These platforms charge between 0.2% to about 1% per annum in fees in return for managing your money. This fee is based on a percentage of the total portfolio held in your account. Option 3: Unit Trusts If you prefer to have a real person managing your investments on your behalf, you can choose to invest in unit trusts, also known as mutual funds. How unit trusts work is that it pools money from many investors. A professional fund manager is then in charge of investing this money on behalf of investors. One misconception about investing through unit trusts is that investors do not need to do anything. This isn’t true. Investors still need to do their own research before deciding which unit trusts they wish to invest in. There are platforms in Singapore such as FSMOne (powered by Fundsupermart) and dollarDex (investment platform by Singlife) that allow investors to invest in an extensive list of available unit trusts. These platforms also allow investors to make small regular investments each month into unit trusts listed on their platforms. How Active Do I Wish To Be in Managing My Investments? While all the options mentioned above are good ways to get started, there are some factors you should consider before deciding which is most ideal for you, most importantly being: How active do you want to be in managing your investments? Buying ETFs and stocks directly requires you to take a keen interest in the investment process. You have to naturally enjoy the process of building up your investment knowledge and learning about the stock market, as well as individual companies. If that sounds like something you wish to do, you can consider Regular Shares Savings plans. By investing directly on your own, you also keep costs low. If you are not able to commit time to learn the stock market and keep up to date with the movements, you may prefer a robo-advisor. For this, you will be paying slightly more as robo-advisors charge an annual fee for managing your investment. The upside though is that you do not need to take a hands-on approach, as these robo-advisors would automatically rebalance your portfolio on your behalf. Read Also: Here Are 4 Critical Success Factors to Consider When Investing If you prefer a professional fund manager to make decisions on your behalf, you can consider investing through unit trusts. Most unit trusts are set up to make investments in certain regions and asset classes (e.g. shares, bonds) so you still need to decide which unit trusts are suitable for you. The point here is that regardless of the investment options you decide on, it’s possible for most people to get started on investing from as little as $100 each month.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING 6 Ways You Can Invest Your First $1,000 In Singapore You don’t need a lot of money to start investing by This article contains affiliate links. DollarsAndSense may receive a share of the revenue from your sign-ups. You can refer to our editorial policy here. Investing beyond the daily necessities of life has usually been thought of as a rich man’s game. This may have been true in the past decades, as there were few investment vehicles that accepted a small capital outlay. But not anymore. Today, technological advancements have altered our perceptions of investments and our ability to participate in them. Unlike in the past, investors now have more asset classes and investment products to choose from. These include the traditional forms of investments like stocks, property, and bonds, as well as newer forms of investments like cryptocurrency, peer-to-peer lending, and Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) funds. We could now begin investing in them with a small capital of between $100 and $1,000. This is beneficial for us as investing in the right product allows us to beat the inflation monster that erodes the purchasing value of money over time. Moreover, when we start investing early, we have more runway to compound our returns. Which is why, we should start investing even if we have a small savings of $1,000. We have curated a list of 6 ways in which new investors could start investing for as little as $1,000 in Singapore.  #1 Invest In Yourself Warren Buffet once said, “The best investment you can make is an investment in yourself”. And, according to him, his best investment was a $100 Dale Carnegie public speaking course, despite what many would have thought. It takes us at least 15 years of formal education to complete our tertiary education and be hired in a professional capacity. Yet, we either neglect the importance of learning or find shortcuts (ie: stock tips) when it comes to our investments. Thankfully, in this digital age, we have access to a plethora of information at our fingertips. Open online learning marketplaces such as Udemy, Coursera, and Skillshare offer convenient-access and affordable courses on a host of topics, including trading and investing. Furthermore, there are many accredited and non-accredited investment courses structured for our local context. This could be useful for those seeking a more traditional hand-holding session. For the IBF-accredited investment courses from 1 January 2023, Singapore citizens under 40 could tap on the IBF’s Financial Training Scheme (FTS) to get up to 30% in course fees subsides (capped at $500 per person), while those over 40 could receive up to 70% (capped at $500 per person).

They are seen as an alternative to the traditional means of using a financial adviser for investment advice. Robo advisors provide access to their platform, allowing users to select funds based on their risk profile and investment goals. These robo funds invest in either ETFs or unit trusts, or a combination of both, using their unique investment methodology and algorithms. It costs little to no sales charges and requires minimal annual fees to invest in a diversified, passively managed investment strategy. Amongst the many robo advisors that are available, these are some of the robo advisors that allow you to invest with them for $1,000 or less.

Instead of committing to an initial large sum of investment, you can invest through the RSS plans with just a small amount of capital in your choice of investment, be it stocks, ETFs, or even unit trusts. There are many platforms, such as POSB (or DBS) Invest-Saver, OCBC Blue Chip Investment Plan, Philip Share Builders Plan that allow investors to start investing as low as $100 in selected stocks and ETFs.

They are debt instruments that provide a fixed rate of return. The bond asset class could be seen as a form of diversification during periods of high volatility in the equity market. The general rule of thumb is that an investor should hold a smaller bond allocation when they are young or equivalent to their age. That is, a 25-year-old can invest up to 25% in bonds and 75% in stocks, whereas a 60-year-old can invest 60% in bonds and 40% in stocks. Bonds can be classified as either investment grade or high-yield grade. Investment grade bonds tend to have a lower risk of default and consequently a lower rate of return compared to high-yield bonds, which gives a higher return to compensate for the higher risk of default.

However, with retail corporate bonds, investors can trade in smaller nominal values of $1,000 through the Singapore Stock Exchange. Among a small pool of retail bonds, the Astrea series of bonds and SIA’s bonds have more liquidity on the exchange.

The SSBs are capital guaranteed by the Singapore government and step-up the interest rates every year over the 10-year maturity period. However, investors could redeem their SSB bond holdings at any time without incurring a penalty. The average 10-year yield of SSBs has typically been above 3%. The minimum investment is $500, with a maximum limit of $200,000 per individual. The application is open from the first business day of the month to the fourth last business day of the month.

In this current low interest rate environment, the CPF interest rates of between 2.5% and 4% have prompted many CPF members to top-up (a record amount of $4 billion) in either their own or their loved ones’ retirement savings in 2021. CPF members who top up via the Retirement Sum Topping-Up Scheme (RSTU) could earn 4% on their Special Account (SA). In fact, you can earn an additional 1% interest on your first $60,000 of combined balances, which is capped at $20,000 for Ordinary Account. If you have not achieved your Full Retirement Sum (FRS), you could consider topping up your SA as a form of investment towards your retirement. You may also get tax relief of up to $8,000 for self-contribution per calendar year.

It is believed that when we as investors guide our money based on our core principles about sustainability and social responsibility, it will influence corporations to adopt a similar strategy with their investments as well. Investors can invest in companies with high ESG ratings using the ESG-thematic funds from robo advisors such as Endowus, StashAway, and Syfe to name a few. You can also view the ESG ratings of each SGX-listed stock or invest in the soon-to-be launched (28 April 2022) low carbon ETF. The iEdge-OCBC Singapore Low Carbon Select 50 Capped Index will consist of the top 50 Singapore companies with lower carbon intensity. Investors can buy the ETF in small lot sizes of 1 unit for as little as $1 per unit (IPO price).

It might be easy to be tempted by the wins of investors who got 5x or 10x returns on their crypto investments. In truth, cryptocurrencies are more volatile compared to traditional asset classes and could lead to a complete loss of investment. Which is why mainstream financial advisors usually exclude cryptocurrencies as an asset class for a typical retail investor. That said, cryptocurrencies are at a nascent stage of development and we have not seen their mass adoption in day-to-day use as intended. Hence, while cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are risky, they continue to hold great potential as a long-term investment.

This allows us to grow our wealth incrementally as we earn and save more. That said, while we have no excuse for delaying our investing journey, we must always do our own due diligence on any investment that we wish to undertake. All investments carry some form of risk and could lead to losses on our initial capital. This article was first published on 17 April 2022 and has been updated with the latest information.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING What Should You Invest In If You Have An Extra $8,000 At The End Of 2022? Saving alone is not enough; you also need to choose the right investments to grow your wealth. by The year-end is approaching, and now is as good a time as any to review your financial health, as our DollarsAndSense writers Angela and Dinesh did with a comprehensive financial review. It is also a time when you may have saved money over the course of the year or will be receiving a lump sum payment in the form of a year-end bonus. Assuming you have $8,000 in spare cash (it could be more or less) and would like to invest this amount instead of spending it on a holiday, these are some of your options. Top Up CPF Account Under The Retirement Sum Topping-Up (RSTU) Scheme More Singaporeans have voluntarily made top-ups under the retirement sum topping up (RSTU) scheme to either their own or their loved ones’ retirement savings in 2022 than in previous years. The CPF system embodies the virtues of compound interest and low investment risk in building up one’s retirement savings through their Special Account (SA) or Retirement Account (RA). This is a good option to consider when investing your $8,000, especially if you have not reached your full retirement sum (FRS) of $192,000. You would not only get the minimum interest rate floor of 4% per annum (p.a.) on your savings but could get a dollar-for-dollar tax deduction of up to $16,000 when making a RSTU cash top up to your and your loved ones’ retirement accounts. How Much Can You Earn: If you’re under 55, you would be able to earn up to 5% interest p.a. on the first $60,000 of combined CPF balances (capped at $20,000 for Ordinary Account). This translates to a return of between $320 and $400 for an $8,000 investment in your SA. If you’re over 55, you could earn up to 6% p.a., which is capped at the first $30,000 of combined CPF balances (capped at $20,000 for OA) and up to 5% p.a. on the next $30,000 (capped at $20,000 for OA). This allows you to earn up to $480 per year in interest returns in your RA. Read Also: Pros And Cons Of Making RSTU Top-Ups To Your CPF Account At The Start Of The Year Contribute To Supplementary Retirement Scheme Another government scheme that is meant to encourage individuals to voluntarily save for retirement above their CPF savings is the supplementary retirement scheme (SRS). Singaporeans and permanent residents can get tax relief for every dollar they put into the SRS, up to a maximum of $15,300 per year—or $35,700 per year for foreigners—up to a personal income tax relief cap of $80,000. The cash contributions made to your SRS account can be used to purchase various investment instruments like Singapore Savings Bonds (SSBs), Singapore Government Securities (SGS bonds), stocks, unit trusts, and insurance products. The advantage of using the SRS is that your investment returns are accumulated tax-free, and only 50% of withdrawals from the SRS are taxable at the retirement age of 63 (effective from 1 July 2022). Read Also: 10 Investments You Can Make With Your Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) Account How Much Can You Earn: Depending on your income and other eligible tax reliefs, the tax savings from contributing to SRS may differ. For example, using the IRAS Income tax calculator, a 30-year-old with an annual income of $50,000, assuming no other personal tax reliefs, could save $560 with an $8,000 contribution. Instead of keeping the $8,000 investment in the SRS as cash, which would only yield 0.05% p.a. or $40.15 in interest, you could invest in other high-yielding investments. Due to the current high interest rate environment, you can currently invest in government bonds like the SSB [GX23010Z – 3.26%] and Treasury bills [BS22123S – 3.9% p.a.] at attractive yields. If you have a longer investment horizon, you can take more risks by putting your money into individual stocks, ETFs, or unit trusts, which could give you higher returns, though they come with greater volatility. Read Also: How To Maximise Our SRS Funds For Retirement Amidst High Inflation Invest In Low Volatility Cash Management Accounts If you’re intending to keep your savings for short-term needs, then you may hold your $8,000 savings in high-interest-bearing savings accounts like the DBS Multiplier, which gives up to 4.10% p.a., the OCBC 360, which gives up to 7.65% p.a., and the UOB One, which gives up to 7.8% p.a. While these accounts give you a higher interest rate on your savings, you may be required to fulfil certain conditions, such as a minimum additional spending in different categories, in order to qualify. Nevertheless, even if you do not fulfil all the conditions, you could still easily earn more than the standard rate (0.05% p.a.) on regular savings accounts. Alternatively, you could also consider switching to savings accounts like the CIMB StarSaver, which earns you an interest rate of up to 3.50% on your regular savings without any investment limit. These options allow you to grow your investment with low risk and without any lock-in period. Cash management funds are another option for either short-term investing or seeking shelter from current market volatility. In a rising interest environment, short duration bond funds are able to capture the higher rates as the (lower-yielding) maturing bonds are reinvested into higher-yielding bonds. How Much Can You Earn: This depends on the cash management fund that you select, which can be above 3% p.a. or more, and on the promotions offered. For instance, by investing $8,000 in moomoo Cash Plus, for 3 months you could get up to $98.90 in guaranteed rewards and a further $20 in cashback on the (limited-time) promotions alone.

As a result, investors may shun equities in favour of safer instruments like short-term bonds or fixed deposits. However, the equity market has a better potential to generate higher returns, which are also able to beat the rate of inflation over the long term, than these safer instruments. One way to stay invested in the equity market is through equity exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like the SPDR Straits Times Index ETF (SGX:ES3) and SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY). Investing in these equity ETFs with $8,000 can be done in two ways: you can invest it all at once (also known as lump sum investing), or you can split it up and invest about $650 per month using the dollar-cost averaging (DCA) method. How Much Can You Earn: With a possible recession looming in 2023, you may consider investing using the DCA approach, which may generate a better return when there is significant market volatility. However, if you believe the markets will recover and move upward, you could choose the lump sum approach, which would be better in an uptrending market. The table below shows the returns for the two ETFs—SPDR STI ETF and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF—based on their respective base currencies.

Pay Off Housing Loan For most Singaporeans–in a country with a high homeownership rate–our primary place of residence is also our biggest investment. This is not surprising given the high property prices even for public housing, which has seen a record number of HDB resale flats breach the million-dollar mark in 2022. The previous decade of low 1% p.a. interest rates may have encouraged more HDB homeowners to take bank home loans instead of HDB housing loans. Even private homeowners may have liked floating interest rate packages more in the past than fixed interest rate packages. But, with interest rates rising sharply to above 3% p.a. for the floating rate packages and above 4% p.a. for the fixed rate packages in 2022, homeowners who are close to the end of the commitment period would be facing higher borrowing costs. You could consider making a partial prepayment and saving on the (rising) interest costs if your home package allows for it. After all, a penny saved is a penny earned!

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING The 4 Different Kinds Of Financial Losses (And Why They Matter) Different levels of pain by People, in general, don’t like to lose. As a society, we applaud winners and put down losers. After all, our species depends on the survival of the fittest. Loss aversion is hardwired into our brains. We perceive the pain of losing twice as strongly as compared to the joy of gaining. With the financial markets roiled by recent turbulence, some of us may be suffering from some form of financial loss and the psychological pain that comes with it. Read Also: Young Investors: 5 Reasons Why You Actually Can’t Afford To Lose Money Or Take High Risks #1 Loss Of “House Money” In casinos, house money refers to when a gambler takes winnings from previous bets and uses some or all of them in subsequent bets. This term is borrowed over to the investment world to coin the term: house money effect. The house money effect suggests that people tend to buy higher-risk stocks or other assets after profitable trades. However, with greater risk, comes the potential for greater gains and losses as well. For example, we invested $500 in bitcoin before 2020 and we profited 400% when we sold it sometime in 2021. Taking our profit of $2,000, we decide to invest in other crypto investments such as Luna and TerraUSD to earn yields as high as 20% p.a. We then reinvested our returns and eventually grew our crypto portfolio to $20,000. However, the Luna de-peg happened and suddenly our portfolio crashed to $200. We have suddenly lost our house money of $20,000. Thankfully, we haven’t technically lost any real capital because we had recouped our initial investment capital of $500. However, we may have lost out on the opportunity cost of deploying that $500 to other purposes or investments. The loss of “house money” while painful, isn’t as debilitating as other forms of financial losses. However, it is a reminder of the importance of protecting our capital and the foolery of taking on too much risk. Pain level: Grief of dreams and could-have-beens Read Also: Diamond Hands Vs Paper Hands: What’s The Meaning Of These Two Popular Investment Terms #2 Capital Loss Capital loss is more damaging to our finances compared to “house money” loss because we are losing not just our potential profits but also the hard-earned capital. For most of us, the initial sum of money (the capital) we use for investing is earned with blood, sweat and tears from salary or savings. We incur capital loss when we sell our investment for less than the original purchase price. Taking the same example, if we had invested $20,000 in capital into the same crypto portfolio, instead of growing it from “house money”, it is likely that we would feel the same pain of the potential profit loss on top of the pain of losing the money earned though hours of work or years of savings. Sometimes the loss of “house money” also incurs capital loss if we had continued to invest our capital along with our profits. Regardless, capital loss is often damaging to our finances as these funds are often the basis of our financial planning. Whether we are saving up for a housing downpayment, our child’s education or our future retirement, having that lump sum wiped out would take time to recover from. Pain level: Grief over loss of funds and the time, blood, sweat and tears to build up those funds. And the opportunity cost of rebuilding these funds Read Also: James Yeo Started His Blog, SmallCapAsia, After Losing A 5-Figure Sum, To Help Others In Their Journey Of Building The Right Knowledge #myfirstloss #3 Unrealised Loss Or Paper Loss However, capital loss is different from unrealised loss or paper loss. Capital loss is only incurred when we sell. If we continue to hold the investment, it is technically an unrealised loss or paper loss because we have not yet sold and realised the loss. Just because the loss isn’t realised doesn’t mean that it will recover in value. Sometimes, it may be better to realise the loss than to let the paper loss continue. For example, in the initial stages of Luna de-peg, some investors sold and realised their losses (some may even incur capital loss, not just a loss of “house money”). However, some investors may have continued to hold on to Luna because they believed that it is a temporary paper loss and Luna’s value would recover, which did not happen. Sometimes, the choice of realising the losses is not up to us as individual investors. For equities, a paper loss may be realised when the company declares bankruptcy or delists. Some corporate actions will force shareholders to realise their investment gains or losses. Pain level: Roller coaster of emotions, sleeplessness and anxiety as the paper losses change Read Also: Are Paper Losses “Real” Losses? And What Should Investors Do When Their Investments Fall In Value #4 Leveraged Loss Unrealised losses can also be realised due to margin calls. This can happen when there is a sharp decline in value (paper loss) in a margin account. To maintain the minimum value in the margin account, the brokerage will require the investor to deposit additional funds. If the investor is unable to deposit more funds, the broker may close the existing account holdings to meet the minimum value requirements. When a margin call happens, the paper losses may be realised to actual losses. Not only are these losses capital losses, but they are also leveraged losses. In a margin account, investors use margin financing or leverage to trade and invest in more shares to earn higher returns. Because of the leverage, the risks and returns are amplified. For leveraged loss, you not only lose your potential profits and/or capital, but you also incur debt along with loss. For example, we have a margin account with 5x leverage. We buy $10,000 of Tesla using $2,000 of our own money and we borrow the other $8,000 from the broker. Tesla’s share price then fell from $1,200 to $700, leaving us with a loss of $4,166. If we sell and realise the loss (possibly because of a margin call), we will obtain $5,384 which means we still owe the broker $2,616 ($8,000 – $5,384). We have not only lost our capital of $2,000 but we also incur a debt of $2,616. The danger of using leverage is that it not only amplifies our gains but also our losses. Any drop in value is magnified when leverage is used, and this also makes investors more likely to make trading or investment mistakes such as panic selling.

The DCA approach on the STI ETF gained the highest return of 19% from 2020 to April 2022, whereas the ARK Innovation ETF lost 40%.  by Some may say that a comparison between the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) and the Straits Times Index (STI) ETF is like the biblical battle between David and Goliath. They represent the clash between traditional businesses and new-age business models. After all, the market capitalisation of both the ARKK and STI ETFs as of 29 April 2022 was US $12 billion and SGD $1.7 billion, respectively. The difference between them is more than the size of the funds. The ARKK is an actively managed fund, run by its CEO, Cathie Woods. The fund selects and invests in companies that are relevant to its disruptive innovation investment theme. Meanwhile the STI ETF is a passively managed fund that tracks the performance of the top 30 stocks listed on the Singapore Exchange. During the last pandemic-fueled recession in 2020, many local investors shunned the slow-moving STI ETF in favour of the innovation-focused ARK ETF. So, how have these two ETFs performed over the last two years? We calculated the performance of both ETFs using a lump sum and a dollar-cost average investment approach to find out. Lump Sum Investment Approach We will begin our comparison between the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) and the SDPR Straits Times Index (ES3) using a lump-sum investment approach. This assumes that we are able to invest a larger sum of capital at one time and we don’t continue contributing regularly to the investment. Read Also: Understanding How Regular & Lump Sum Savings Plans Work In Singapore Lump Sum Investing In ARK Innovation ETF  Let’s work out the calculation if you invested a lump sum of USD $28,000 as your investment capital in ARK Innovation ETF from 2020 to 2022. Based on the investment capital of $28,000 and the entry price of $50.50 per unit, you would have received a total of 554.4554 units of the ARKK. *Till End April 2022 First, let’s look at a year-by-year return. Had you started investing in the ARKK in 2020, your investment would have gained over 146%. However, had you started investing in the ARKK at the start of either 2021 or 2022, you would have had a net loss of (-24%) and (-51%), respectively. In total, had you stayed invested in ARKK from the start of 2020 to the end of April 2022, your initial $28,000 investment value would have dropped to $26,131, or a loss of (-6.7%). The ARKK distributes one round of dividends annually in December. If we were to include the two rounds of dividends ($2.827) collected for the total number of ARKK ETF units held from 2020 to 2022, it would have amounted to $1,567.45 or 5.6% based on the initial cost of investment. This cushions the overall net loss on your investment capital to around -$301.06 or -1.08%.

Based on the investment capital of $28,000 and the entry price of $3.31 per unit, you would have received a total of 8459.2145 units of the STI ETF. *Till End April 2022 First, let’s look at a year-by-year return. Had you started investing in the STI ETF in 2020, your investment would have lost over (-12%). However, had you started investing in STI at the start of either 2021 or 2022, you would have had a net gain of (+9%) and (+6%), respectively. In total, had you stayed invested in the STI ETF from the start of 2020 to the end of April 2022, your initial $28,000 investment value would have gained by +2.4%, or an investment value of $28,676. The STI ETF distributes two rounds of dividends annually, in February and August. If we were to include the five rounds of dividends ($0.249) collected for the total number of STI ETF units held from 2020 to 2022, it would have amounted to $2,106.34. This will bring your overall net gain on your investment capital to around $2,783.08, or 9.94%. Dollar-Cost Average (DCA) Investment Approach Next, we will use the dollar-cost average method to compare the returns between the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) and the SDPR Straits Times Index (ES3). This approach involves investing a specified amount at regular intervals (e.g. every month or quarter), depending on the investor’s preference.

For our calculation, we have used the closing price of the first trading day of each month as our purchase price. Total Investment From 2020 (January) to 2022 (April): $28,000\n",
      "Total Units Held At April 2022: 334.6054 shares\n",
      "Average Cost Per Share: $83.68\n",
      "Total Dividends Received: $945.93\n",
      "Dividend Yield (on cost): 3.38% If you had DCA into ARKK from January 2020 to April 2022 based on a monthly contribution of $1,000, you would have accumulated a total of 334.6054 units at a total cost of $28,000. The average cost of one full unit would be $83.68. Based on the closing price ($47.13) on 29 April 2022, your investment value would have dropped to $15,769.95. This represents a loss of (-$12,230.05) or (-43.68%). As mentioned earlier, ARKK distributed one round of dividends in 2020 and 2021, which amounted to a total of $945.93 in dividends collected for the units held. This represents a dividend yield of 3.38% based on the initial cost of investment. After including the dividends for the three-year period, it would have amounted to a total investment loss of -$11,284.12 or (-40.30%).

For our calculation, we have used the closing price on the first trading day of each month as our purchase price. Total Investment From 2020 (April) to 2022 (April): $28,000\n",
      "Total Units Held At April 2022: 9,505.4814 shares\n",
      "Average Cost Per Share: $2.945\n",
      "Total Dividends Received: $1,166.93\n",
      "Dividend Yield (on cost): 4.15% If you had invested in the STI ETF from January 2020 to April 2022 based on a monthly contribution of $1,000, you would have accumulated a total of 9505.4814 units at a cost of $28,000. The average cost of one unit is $2.945. Based on the closing price ($3.39) on 29 April 2022, your investment value would be worth $32,223.58 or a gain of 15.08%. As mentioned earlier, the STI ETF distributes dividends twice a year. You would have received a total of five rounds of dividends from 2020 to 2022, amounting to a total of $1,166.93. This represents a dividend yield of 4.15% based on the cost of investment. After including the dividends received, the total gain in the STI ETF would amount to $5,387.51, or 19.24%. Read Also: How Much Dividends Do Stocks In The STI ETF Pay Out Each Year? Lump Sum Investing Or Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA): Which Is A Better Strategy? By comparing the returns achieved using both the lump sum and dollar-cost average strategies, we can conclude that the highest return was derived using the DCA approach on the STI ETF.   The lump sum investment approach worked better for ARKK, even though the returns were negative. The investor was able to get more units of the ETF and therefore, more dividends for the same comparison period using the lump sum approach compared to the DCA approach. The lump sum approach works well if the underlying instrument trends strongly upwards like the price action observed in 2020 on ARKK. However, if the investor uses the DCA approach in a up trending market, they would have little opportunity to buy more units or lower their average price. However, if we look at the price action for the STI ETF, it’s not hard to see why the DCA approach worked better. The STI ETF was generally in a sideways trend for most periods, though it gradually climbed higher over the last two years. This allowed the investor who used the DCA approach to accumulate more units of the STI ETF at a lower average price than the lump sum approach. Therefore, we should not discount any instrument based on its trend alone. By using the right investment approach, we could reap the best possible return regardless of the market conditions.

FSMOne ETF Regular Savings Plan The number of counters available: 71 ETFs listed on SGX, HKEX & US markets. Fees: Which Should You Use? A common question that many new investors frequently ask is which of the four firms should they use. The answer is that it largely depends on a few key factors. Stocks you intend to buy: Phillip Share Builders Plan offers the widest range of individual stocks that you can invest in. If your intention is to just invest in ETFs, you can choose either DBS/POSB Invest-Saver or FSMOne ETF Regular Savings Plan. If you want to invest in stocks as well, you have to go with OCBC Blue Chip Investment Plan and Phillip Share Builders Plan. If you want to invest in overseas counters, you can only do so via the FSMOne ETF Regular Savings Plan, which offers 71 ETFs listed in Singapore, Hong Kong, and the US. Your intended monthly investment: As the fees charged by each of these brokers vary slightly, your intended investment amount each month can play a part in determining which of the four firms offers you the best rate. The table below shows the most suitable investment amount for each firm. * Note that the number of counters you are investing in will also make a difference. Read Also: Which Monthly Investment Plan Is Suitable For You? Step 2: Open An Account With The Brokerage Firm Once you have decided which firm you wish to use, you can open an investment account with the firm. For OCBC and POSB, you can start investing in their RSS plans as long as you have an existing savings account with the bank. Simply login through your internet banking account, and click on their respective investment tabs. We managed to set up our RSS plans online with both these firms in less than five minutes. POSB Invest-Saver OCBC BCIP  Phillip Share Builders Plan If you have an existing Phillip securities trading account, you can apply for this account online. Alternatively, you may complete an SBP Application Form, an Inter-bank GIRO form and apply for a POEMS trading account (if you do not have any). FSMOne ETF Regular Savings Plan If you have an existing FSMOne account, you can start investing in the ETFs on the FSMOne platform online. Step 3: Ensure Sufficient Funds In Your Designated Account The money that is used for your monthly investments will need to be withdrawn from an account. For POSB and OCBC, this would be your savings account. If you have more than one savings account with the bank, you will be asked to designate which savings account to withdraw the funds from each month. For FSMOne ETF Regular Savings Plan and Phillip Share Builders Plan, you will need to authorise a GIRO deduction. Regardless of which firm you use, you need to ensure that there are sufficient funds in the account where money will be withdrawn. Otherwise, the transaction will not take place or be halted after a few months. Step 4: Set Up Your Standing Instruction/Order The final step is to set up your standing instruction. These would include the stock(s) that you wish to invest in each month and how much you intend to invest each time. Your instruction/order will be carried out every month until you 1) change your instructions or 2) have insufficient funds in your savings/prefunded account to complete the order. There is no lock-in period for your standing instructions. You may cancel or change your instruction any time you like and as often as you wish. Step 5: Monitor Your Investments Regularly It’s important that you do not forget to monitor your investments. An invest-and-forget attitude isn’t recommended for RSS plans, as the firm will continue making monthly investments on your behalf based on your standing instructions. As you build up your investment knowledge and confidence, you may decide to invest in different stocks and may also increase your monthly investments. After a while, you may even decide to start picking stocks or trading on your own. Even if you do so, you may still see value in retaining a dollar-cost averaging strategy via your RSS plans. Remember, with RSS plans, you will continue to retain full flexibility and control over your investment decisions even after committing to embark on it. If you have a question about RSS plans, feel free to ask us your question on our Facebook page and we will do our best to answer it. Read Also: Buying A New iPhone Every Year?

If you have thought about being financially independent or enjoying a life of retirement, you probably heard of FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early). Just knowing or thinking about FIRE won’t bring you any closer to it, you need action. Here are 7 habits of financially independent people you can emulate to get closer to your goal of FIRE.  #1 Start A Side Hustle Ever dreamed of starting your own business or being your own boss? Starting a side hustle can be a great way to generate extra income and enjoy some personal fulfillment. While most people think of creating another source of income by hustling, there is a hustle-free alternative: investing.

Optimising your schedule becomes even more important as you find ways to boost your income. Save time and effort by automating your finances. #3 Set Good Financial Habits However much we earn, poor financial habits can derail our progress to FIRE. Instead, get into a habit of timely bill payments and regular investments. Automate bill payments and set up regular investments and take advantage of dollar-cost averaging. #4 Pay Your Future Self First Instead of saving what’s left over after you pay off your bills, credit cards and other expenses, set aside your savings first when you receive your monthly salary.   #5 Track Your Spending One way to identify problem areas in your spending is by tracking your expenses. By reviewing your purchases, you can see if it is the bubble tea addiction or reliance on food delivery that is causing the overspending and whether you can cut down on these areas. #6 Maintain Good Cash Flow And An Emergency Fund Having an emergency fund is important for financial security. As a rule of thumb, keep enough cash savings for about 6 months of expenses for emergencies. #7 Make Your Every Dollar Work Investing is the key to FIRE.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING Syfe Core and Syfe Equity100: What Are the Differences Between These Two Robo-Advisory Portfolios? Syfe Core portfolios have the same (Smart Beta) factor investing as Syfe Equity100 but with enhanced exposure to China, and inclusion of bond and gold ETFs. by This article was written in collaboration with Syfe. All views expressed in this article are the independent opinion of DollarsAndSense.sg based on our research. DollarsAndSense.sg is not liable for any financial losses that may arise from any transactions and readers are encouraged to do their own due diligence. You can view our full editorial policy here. This article was originally published on 13 March 2021 and updated with new information.  Syfe, one of the popular robo-advisories in Singapore, has been busy launching investment solutions for investors. Following the successful launch of Cash+, their cash management account in January 2021, Syfe is back with a new portfolio solution: Syfe Core, which has 3 different portfolios to suit every investor. For those of us who have already started investing with Syfe, we may be wondering about the difference between Syfe Core and the existing Equity100. Equity100 Is Pure Play Equities (100% Investment In Stocks) Syfe Equity100 is a fully managed portfolio that invests 100% of our monies into equities. Equity100 enables us to gain investment exposure to a highly diversified pool of 1500+ stocks through its underlying Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). These ETFs are identified using Syfe’s Smart Beta strategy, which tilts the portfolio towards three key factors – growth, large market capitalisation and low volatility that the Syfe investment team has identified as factors that will generate better performance. Unlike most other robo-advisory portfolios, Equity100 is designed to maximise returns. This means 100% of your funds are invested into equities. During a stock market crash, such as what happened in March 2020, the drawdown on Equity100 can be quite high as the portfolio is only exposed to equities and no other asset classes. On the flip side, the 100% allocation to stocks also means that Equity100 can capture higher returns when the market is on a bull run. For investors who want to earn high returns in the stock market, and are willing to accept higher volatility, Equity100 may be a suitable portfolio for you.

However, not every investor may be keen to accept high volatility on their portfolio. This is where the Syfe Core comes in. Syfe Core Provides Equities Exposure While Also Prioritising Risk-Adjusted Returns To address the needs of investors who want the equities exposure while reducing the downside risks, Syfe has created Syfe Core, a suite of 3 portfolios – Core Defensive, Core Balanced and Core Growth – which maximises risk-adjusted returns. Syfe Core does this by using equity ETFs, bond ETFs and gold ETF to create their portfolios. The equity component of the portfolio helps investors generate the high returns they want using the Smart Beta methodology, while the bond and gold components provide the portfolio with downside protection.  Source: Syfe Through their equity component, Syfe Core offers exposure to over 3,500 different companies from diverse sectors.  Currently, the top equity allocations include tech stocks such as Apple, Microsoft and Google; China stocks such as Tencent and Alibaba; consumer staples and consumer discretionary such as Amazon, Procter & Gamble and PepsiCo; as well as Tesla.  Syfe Core Offers 3 Portfolios To Cater To Different Risk Tolerances  Every investor has a different appetite for returns and tolerance for risk. Syfe Core addresses this by offering 3 different portfolios: Core Defensive, Core Balanced and Core Growth. Each of these portfolios offer a different allocation to the underlying equities ETF, bonds ETF and gold ETF. Core Defensive has the lowest equity exposure and highest bond exposure and is focused on long-term capital preservation. It is ideal for investors with less tolerance for volatility. Investors can also use Core Defensive for investments with a short-term time horizon where the priority is capital preservation, such as investing for a home deposit. Core Balanced is between the two other options, with moderate equity and bond exposure. This is suitable for investors with moderate tolerance for risk and volatility, or investment goals that have a mid to long term time horizon, such as investing for children’s education. Core Growth has the most equity exposure and is growth-oriented. The high equity exposure makes it more volatile but also means that the returns are higher over the long term. This is suitable for investors with high tolerance for risk and volatility or investment goals with a long time horizon, such as investing for retirement.  Source: Syfe The different allocations to the non-equity components provide different degrees of downside protection to the different portfolios. For example, according to Syfe, the potential drawdown for Core Growth is 9.97% compared to Core Defensive’s 4.90%. On the flipside, the higher equities exposure also leads to higher returns with Core Growth having a 13.2% five-year annualised return compared to Core Defensive’s 6.1%.  Source: Syfe Both Syfe Core And Equity100 Use Smart Beta Allocation Syfe uses their Smart Beta factor investing strategy for allocation in the equities component of Syfe Core. This is the same factor investing strategy present in Equity100. Currently, this is a tilt towards growth, a geographical tilt towards China and a tilt towards low volatility. For the geographical tilt towards China, this includes iShares MSCI China ETF (MCHI) and KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (KWEB). In line with greater exposure to Chinese stocks, Core portfolios have a greater geographical allocation to China. For example, Core Growth has a 14% allocation to China while Core Balanced has a 7% allocation. For the tilt towards growth, Syfe has increased exposure through ETFs such as Invesco QQQ and Invesco S&P500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP). The QQQ is a technology-heavy ETF that tracks the performance of the NASDAQ-100 index while the RSP tracks the S&P500 on an equal-weighted basis. The addition of RSP adds a value factor tilt as each stock (including small-cap stock) is equally represented instead of being allocated according to their market cap. As for the tilt towards low volatility, this exposure is through sector ETFs such as Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP), Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV), Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU) and Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK).  Mix And Match The Various Syfe Portfolios To Suit Our Preference While Syfe Core can be a standalone all-in-one portfolio solution for investors, some of us may also prefer to use Syfe Core to form the bulk of our portfolios, while supplementing it with other investments or portfolios.  Source: Syfe Syfe products are designed to work in tandem with each other. For example, you could use Syfe Core Balanced to form the bulk of your overall portfolio, take a smaller position in the stock market using Equity100, generate a stream of stable income using REIT+ and hold your emergency fund in Cash+. In the end, every investor has different needs and preferences. Syfe considers these different preferences and makes it easy to mix and match the various investment strategies and portfolios so that you can also construct a portfolio that is suitable for you.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING Guide To Value Investing In Singapore If uncovering hidden gems in the flea market is what you like to do, then value investing could be an investment strategy worth considering. by If you are new to investing, you may have heard about different investment strategies such as value investing, growth investing or index investing. However, as a newbie investor, you may find yourself struggling to understand the different strategies and applying them to guide your investment decisions. In this article, we will explain what value investing is and what are some of the key differences between value investing and other popular types of investment strategies. What Is Value Investing? Value investing is an investment strategy where investors focus on finding stocks that they believe are undervalued , in other words, cheaper than what they are worth. Value investors believe that not all stocks are fairly valued, and thus, if you pick and invest in the right stocks, you can generate a higher return than the market. This may appear like a logical way to invest. After all, as investors whose aim is to generate a good return on our investment, shouldn’t we always be on the lookout for undervalued stocks to invest in? Not always. Value Investing Vs Growth Investing You see, many retail investors actually are not value investors (whether they know this or not is another matter). For example, suppose we are investing in Tesla today. Based on Tesla’s current financial numbers, its Price-To-Earnings ratio (P/E) is about 1,000. It is hard to argue that a value investor would find paying $1,000 to make $1 each year a good deal. In this case, we are likely to be a growth investor (or perhaps a speculative investor) who believe in the growth potential of Tesla. However, this does not imply that Tesla or other growth stocks are bad investments. Rather, It just means that we will probably prefer looking at other stocks as a value investor. Value Investing Vs Index Investing Another popular way of investing is via broad-based index ETFs. Classic examples are the SPDR S&P500 US$ (SGX: ES3) or the Nikko AM STI ETF (SGX: G3B) that track market indices, such as the S&P 500 or the STI. For investors investing in these ETFs, their primary objective is to earn a return that is going to be similar to what the market index is earning, rather than to beat the index. To put it into perspective, index investors seek to earn an average return similar to what the stock market is making while value investors look for investment opportunities that can outperform the market. Read Also: S&P500 vs Straits Times Index: Which Is “Better” For Beginner Singapore Investors? What Should Value Investors Be Looking Out For? In the words of Warren Buffett, “Price is what you pay, value is what you get”. As value investors, we want to buy what is going to be valuable. The aim is NOT to buy what is cheap, but to buy what is valuable. To figure out if a stock is potentially undervalued, there are some key criteria we can look out for. Price-To-Book Value (P/B): Price-To-Book Value (P/B) is the market value of the company’s shares divided by the value of the company’s asset on its balance sheet. A P/B that is above 1 means that a company’s share is trading at a value that is higher than the book value of its assets. A P/B that is below 1 means that a company’s share is trading at a discount to its current asset value. A word of caution, a low P/B value doesn’t automatically mean that a company is undervalued. It could be that a company’s asset is overvalued in the first place, or that the company itself is in an asset-heavy business that requires them to own assets for their business. Price-To-Earnings Ratio (P/E): Price-To-Earnings ratio (P/E) is fairly easy to understand. It measures how much you are paying for a company’s shares for every $1 it earns. If a company has a net profit of $100 million a year and it’s worth $1 billion, this means its P/E is 10. Instinctively, the lower a company’s P/E ratio is, the more undervalued it may appear to be. That said, it is important to delve deeper into its earnings. There is a likelihood that a company is trading at a low P/E because investors are expecting its current earnings to be unsustainable. Price/Earnings-to-Growth (PEG) Ratio: P/E ratio does not take into account expected earning growth. This is where Price/Earnings-to-Growth may come into play as a more accurate indicator to assess the value of a stock. PEG can be calculated by taking [(Price/EPS)/EPS Growth]. If a company has a net profit of $100 million a year and it’s worth $1 billion, this means its P/E is 10. If its earnings growth rate is 20%, this means its PEG ratio is 0.5. The lower a PEG, the more undervalued a stock is considered to be.

Whether Value Investing is a good strategy depends on our views of the financial markets. If we think the market is always efficient, then it’s reasonable to say that value investing doesn’t exactly work. Whenever there is a valuable stock, the market will respond promptly and price it such that we will not find an undervalued company. However, markets are not always efficient. Some stocks that are the flavour of the month may be overvalued while some other quality companies are undervalued because fewer investors know about them. As a value investor, if we are willing to put in the effort to learn, research and analyse these companies, then we may find undervalued stocks. Of course, this is easier said than done. Value investors have to be very familiar with the industries and companies that they have shortlisted. We cannot find undervalued stocks if we do not know what to look for in the first place. And no, taking advice from a friend or an ‘investment expert’ doesn’t count as research. Also, even if we find a handful of undervalued stocks, it’s worth noting that they can remain undervalued for a long time. Often, undervalued stocks are undervalued in the first place for a good reason. It could be that they are in an industry that is not sexy and overlooked by both institutional and retail investors. Thus, if our plan is to invest for a short period of 1-2 years and sell it off thereafter, value investing may not work for us. Finally, as a value investor, it’s advisable that we should look at both the Singapore and overseas markets. The simple reason is that finding undervalued stocks is not always easy and there may be periods where the entire market or industries are overvalued. By having a bigger market to choose our undervalued stocks from, we may discover more investment opportunities. That said, the fundamental principle remains that we should fully understand the companies that we are choosing to invest in.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING Step-By-Step Guide to Stock Investing in Singapore Embark on your own stock investing journey today with this simple 5-step guide. by This article is part of a DollarsAndSense.sg collaboration with . For Tomorrow is brought to you by Temasek, in partnership with MoneySmart and DollarsAndSense. All views expressed in the article are the independent opinion of DollarsAndSense.sg. When you’re ready to start investing, the stock market can be one of the first places you turn to. Most Singaporeans, even if they never invested before, know about the stock market, or more specifically, the Singapore Exchange (SGX). The SGX acts as a marketplace for people to buy and sell stocks. For many, when you start investing, you will likely turn to an online platform to carry out your trades and start building your investment portfolio. For a start, you may think of investing in well-known companies in Singapore, such as DBS, SingTel, OCBC, Keppel Corp, UOB, CapitaLand and more. These companies are all listed on the SGX and you can start adding them to your portfolio. The SGX isn’t a grocery store where you can go to see, smell and touch what you’re actually buying and put them into your shopping cart. So, how do you start investing in these companies? Here’s a step-by-step guide to getting started. #1 Open A Brokerage Account  Before you start buying stocks listed on the SGX, you first need to open a brokerage account. Having an account with an authorised broker gives you access to buy and sell stocks on the SGX. There are many stock brokerages in Singapore that you can choose from. Here’s a list of the stock brokerage firms in Singapore. You would notice that many brokerage firms are either directly linked or have some form of affiliation with a commercial bank operating in Singapore. There are also overseas digital brokers coming into the scene with Interactive Brokers, moomoo and Tiger Brokers. Read Also: Step-By-Step Guide To Opening A Stock Brokerage Account In Singapore Which Brokerage Firm Should You Choose? The first thing most investors look at is the commissions charged by the stock broker. A quick check across brokers in Singapore would reveal that most firms charge similar commission rates between 0.08% and 0.28% of trading value, or a minimum of between $10 and $28 per transaction. This would also vary depending on the type of trading account – CDP-linked or custodian – you choose to open. Aside from commission charges, there are several other factors you should also consider when choosing a firm. Fund Transfer: When you buy stocks, you need to think about how you’d like to pay for them. Some investors may find it more convenient to open a brokerage account with a bank that they already have an existing savings account with. For example, if you already have an OCBC savings account, you may prefer opening a brokerage account with OCBC Securities. By doing so, stocks that you buy can automatically be paid for using money in your designated OCBC savings account. When you sell stocks, the money would be automatically credited into the same account. You can also easily link your bank accounts with any brokerage accounts that you open in Singapore. You can then simply make an Electronic Payment for Shares (EPS) via online or at Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs). You may also choose to make payment via GIRO. Overseas Investments: You may be starting out your investing journey with stocks listed on SGX. As you become more experienced and confident, you may venture into investing in overseas markets as well. Many of the local stock brokerages also allow you to invest in some of the regional and major overseas stock markets, including US, Hong Kong, China, Malaysia, Thailand and others. Read Also: [2021 Edition] Singapore Brokerage Houses: Guide To Investing In Overseas Stock Markets Do note that buying and holding overseas stocks tend to come with additional charges, including currency conversion rates and fees associated with custodian accounts. Platform: Not all brokerage platforms are built the same. We suggest trying out a demo account whenever possible with the brokerage to sample the service and platform. If you can’t try a demo account, you can find out from more experienced friends about how user-friendly the platform is before you open an account with any stock brokerage firm. #2 Open A CDP Account  If this is your first time buying stocks in Singapore, you also need to open a Central Depository (CDP) account. Think of a CDP account as a vault that stores all the SGX stocks that you have bought in a centralised location. In most cases, when you buy a stock through a brokerage firm, the firm doesn’t keep it. Rather, it goes into a CDP account held under your name. The benefit of this is that you can easily move to another stock brokerage firm to continue buying and selling without worrying about your holdings. Do note that not all brokerage firms will automatically deposit the stocks you bought through them into your CDP account. For example, FSMOne and Standard Chartered do not offer CDP-linked accounts and will hold the stocks you bought as a custodian on your behalf. Similarly, the stock brokerage firms that do offer CDP-linked accounts also offer their own custodian accounts. Read Also: Step-By-Step Guide To Opening A CDP Account In Singapore Custodian accounts tend to offer lower brokerage fees as your securities are kept with them, and you will be retained as a customer rather than easily shifting to another stock brokerage firm. However, custodian accounts come with certain fees and charges that you should know as well. #3 Start Off With A Strategy  When you are new to investing, it’s easy to become too excited, leading to you doing too much too quickly – which is typically a bad thing for new investors. For a start, set for yourself small and realistic targets. You can start off with broad-based country index investing, putting a small amount of money into the Straits Times Index (STI) Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) each month. Index investing enables you to get exposure to a diversified portfolio of high-quality companies on the stock exchange. Along the way, you can slowly add individual companies in Singapore and gradually add foreign-listed stocks into your portfolio, or even venture into other asset classes, such as bonds and commodities or even derivatives. Read Also: Value Vs Growth Vs Index Investing: Which Is The Best Strategy For You? Your initial strategy should also include how much money you are investing and how often you would invest. Even if you already have $20,000 set aside to invest, it doesn’t mean you should plough it into the stock market all at once. Instead, you can space out your investment over time. Commonly referred to as dollar cost averaging (DCA), this strategy, allows you to invest without worrying about timing the market. You simply buy more shares when prices go down, and less shares when prices go up as you invest at regular time intervals. Always remember that your investing journey is a marathon and not a sprint. You want to start off at a pace that you are comfortable with and take it from there, rather than sprinting out of the gates and make unnecessary, and costly, mistakes. Neither are you racing against other investors. Hence, do not simply copy the investment strategies of other investors without first understanding for yourself why each investment strategy may or may not work for you. Always bear in mind that other investors may have their own risk appetite and investment time horizon. #4 Understand The Various Types Of Assets On The Stock Exchange  It’s easy to assume that you can only find stocks on the stock exchange. While that might be true when SGX first started in 1973, today’s exchange comprises various asset classes beyond just stocks. For example, you can find retail bonds on the exchange. These include bonds issued by Temasek Holdings’ backed Astrea (Astrea IV4.35%B280614, Astrea V3.85%B290620 and Astrea VI3%B310318), SIA 3.03% 240328 and Aspial (AspialTrea 5.25%b200828). Unlike stocks, where people invest with the hope that prices appreciate over time as the companies grow, bond prices do not fluctuate as much and are generally traded near the price they were first launched at. That makes it a more stable asset class with predictable cash flows. Other asset classes you can find on the exchange include real estate investment trusts (REITs), exchanged traded funds (ETFs), warrants and daily leveraged certificates (DLCs). This makes it important to understand what it is that you are investing in, especially since some of these investments carry much higher risks. #5 Constantly Review Your Strategy And Investment Objectives  Once you get familiar with investing, it’s easy to continue building on your knowledge to learn more and to try out new strategies in order to make better returns. That’s fine. That said, it’s equally important to ensure that new strategies you introduce fall in line with your overall investment objectives. For example, your original plan may have been to invest in high-quality dividend-paying companies primarily to build a secondary source of income. Along the way, you will definitely start reading up more and have conversations with friends and relatives who are in the “know”. This may lead you to invest in companies on rumours or media hype, in the hopes of making a quick buck if the company turns around in the future. This buy-low sell-high strategy would be very different from what you originally set out to do. Always take the time to periodically review your strategy to ensure that it’s in line with your objectives. Start Investing Today There are of course many other areas of investing that you also need to learn. You can even read the articles we have written about various types of investing mistakes that people make. In the meantime, we always advocate for people to start investing early to benefit from a longer time horizon for their money to grow and ride out volatility.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING What Is Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) And How Is It Different From Conventional IPO? Also known as the poor man’s private equity, here is what you need to know about SPAC. by Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPAC) or “blank cheque companies” have been on a rise in 2020. In the United States, a record of US$83.3 million were raised in 2020, 6 times more than the year before. As of March this year, the total SPAC funding raised has eclipsed 2020’s record, hitting US$87.1 million within 3 months. With the SPAC trend generating so much buzz globally, our local Singapore Exchange (SGX) has launched a market consultation with the potential to start SPAC listing as soon as this year. Additionally, SPAC has been gaining momentum among Singapore companies with the likes of Grab, One Championship and Property Guru looking to potentially merge or start their own SPAC in the United States. What Exactly Is SPAC And Why Are They Known As “Blank Cheque Companies”? Created in the 80’s, SPAC is an alternative listing structure for a company to raise capital from the public to acquire one or more companies. The acquired entity have to be a private (unlisted) company. SPACs are typically given 24 to 36 months to identify companies and “De-SPAC” – whereby identified companies are acquired and merged into the publicly trading SPAC holding company. This structure is also the reason why SPACs are called “blank cheque companies”. Upon listing, each shareholder is given a share and a proportion of a warrant. The warrant is the right to buy stocks directly from the SPAC at a given price within a timeframe. While the SPAC is sourcing the right acquisition target, the money raised from the SPAC listing will be placed in a trust. The capital in trust can only be used for costs relevant to acquiring and “De-SPAC-ing”. In the event, a SPAC does not manage to find the target acquisition, they can either request for an extension or return the funds back to the shareholders. As with all listings, the SPAC would have to clear regulatory requirements before going on the stock exchange. These pre-listing regulatory requirements usually involve ensuring a healthy track record on the management team or sponsors, and a reasonable criterion for potential acquisitions. There is no substantial financial due diligence conducted on the SPAC before listing since it is a company without any revenue. How Is SPAC Different From Conventional IPO? #1 Conventional IPO Requires A Revenue Generating Company While SPAC Is A Temporary Fund For conventional IPO, it requires a healthy company with historical financial track records to generate reasonable interest from public investors. This allows investors to see and determine for themselves if they would want to invest in the company. As an investor, you have a clear sight as to the company you are buying into when you invest in an IPO. On the other hand, SPAC is a temporary fund formed with the purpose of acquiring private entit(ies). Once the funds are raised, the management team sources and determines the private companies that are suitable for acquisition. As an investor, you do not necessarily know the companies you are buying into when you invest into a SPAC, instead, you are relying on the capabilities of the management team to source for the right acquisition(s) #2 Conventional IPO Gives Company Share, While SPAC Gives Company Share & Warrant   During an IPO, investors get to subscribe for the initial listing and receive shares of the company upon purchase. For SPAC, when investors subscribe for the initial listing, they not only receive shares but also a full or partial warrant for each share acquired. For example, for every share acquired, an investor could receive a quarter warrant. For a warrant to be executed, it needs to be a whole warrant. Having a warrant allows the investor to purchase more shares directly from the SPAC at a fixed price and investors usually execute or sell warrants during the pre-merger phase. Pairing warrants with shares is a structure that tries to compensate the risk the SPAC shareholder took to invest before a target company is made known. #3 Conventional IPO Valuation Is Determined By Market But SPAC Has A Set Price The act of listing a company on a stock exchange is to raise funds from the public. By going public, companies are placed under the market’s scrutiny and their share value would be determined by their financial performance and capabilities. Being a blank cheque company, SPAC does not generate any revenue. Hence, potential investors would not be able to properly assess the price of a SPAC share. Therefore, the initial listing price of SPACs tends to have a fixed floor. In the United States, SPACs list at an average price of US$10 or higher. #4 SPAC Reduces Time & Cost Needed To List Compared To A Conventional IPO Based on a PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) report, upon finding a target company, a SPAC can take 3 to 6 months to list the acquired company. The listing process can save on underwriting and legal cost as SPAC management teams are usually financial professionals themselves with experiences in taking companies public. This process is almost 4 times shorter than a conventional IPO, which can take 12 to 18 months. #5 SPAC will De-SPAC   As a shareholder of a public company, major corporate activities that can result in large valuation changes are not that common. However, due to the nature of SPAC, shareholders can expect to be involved in at least one major corporate event – “De-SPAC-ing” “De-SPAC” is the process whereby the SPAC acquires or merges with one or more companies. This process is similar to a public company acquiring or merging with another company. Depending on the SPAC, shareholders may get to vote on the transaction. If not, shareholders can choose to redeem their shares’ portion of the trust fund or hold on and continue as a shareholder in the newly merged entity.

As SPAC gains global momentum, Singaporean investors should be aware of this new listing structure and its potential launch in Singapore. While the exact details of how SPAC in Singapore has yet to be ironed out, the generic overall structure of SPAC is as mentioned above. Investors can expect to see a SPAC listing as soon as the end of 2021 if the current public consultations by SGX proceed smoothly.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg CPF Best Ways to Invest Your CPF Money — CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS) Here are some CPFIS-approved ways to invest your CPF monies by This article is republished with permission from The InvestQuest, which also runs the sister site, Endowment Exchange.  In our primer on how to optimize your CPF balances, we highlighted five sequential steps that an individual can take (and their respective rationales): One aspect that was excluded was the CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS). In this article, we offer our thoughts on whether an individual should consider investing their CPF balances, alongside our shortlist of CPF-eligible investments that we deem “optimal”. 1) Introduction to CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS) 2) What is the probability of outperforming CPF interest rates? 3) We would only invest our excess CPF-OA balance 4) Our shortlist of the best eligible investments for CPFIS-OA Appendix: 3-step guide to open a CPF Investment Account   The InvestQuest View We believe it’s worth investing the portion of our CPF-OA balance that’s in excess of our housing needs, especially if the investment horizon is 10 years or more. Regarding what to invest in, we believe that higher-risk assets such as stocks would be the most appropriate, given the relatively high historical probability of beating the 2.5% p.a. CPF-OA interest rate over periods of at least 5 – 10 years. Lastly, we summarize the “best” investment vehicles that we would consider for our own CPF-OA investments. Disclaimer: Below, we’ve highlighted what we see as the best CPFIS-eligible investments for our own CPF-OAs. Everyone’s financial circumstance and priorities differ. As always, please do your own due diligence before making investment/financial decisions. 1) Introduction to CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS) The CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS) gives individuals the option to invest their OA and SA balances to enhance their retirement nest egg. You will be able to invest your CPF OA and SA balances, after meeting the following conditions: The eligible types of investment products under CPFIS are included in the table below. Details on the specific shares, ETFs, unit trusts, ILPs and bonds that may be purchased under CPFIS may be found in this link.  For CPF-OA, there are limits on how much you can invest in certain product types For the purchase of “single stocks + corporate bonds + property funds” using CPF-OA, the limit is capped at 35% of “investible savings” For the purchase of “Gold-related investments” using their CPF-OA, the limit is capped at 10% of “investible savings”. What are “Investible Savings”? “Investible savings” is the sum of three parts: For example, if you have a CPF-OA balance of $50k, and assuming you have already used $30k of CPF-OA for investments and another $20k of CPF-OA for education (both of which have not been repaid), your “investible savings” would be $100k. This means you would be able to invest up to $35k of CPF-OA into “single stocks + corporate bonds + property funds” and $10k into “Gold-related investments”, given the investment limits of 35% and 10% respectively. For CPF-OA, there are no investment limits for ETFs or Unit Trusts Do note that these investment limits do not apply to ETFs or Unit Trusts. Hence, as long as you leave $20k in your OA, the excess can be fully used on these products, which includes popular vehicles such as the SPDR Straits Times Index ETF, despite the ETF being 100% invested in stock. 2) What is the probability of CPFIS outperforming CPF interest rates? We’re focusing on stock-related investments in our analysis Investing comes with risk. CPF members should only invest via CPFIS if an investment has a high probability of returning more than the prevailing CPF interest rates (2.5% p.a. on OA balances and 4% p.a. on SA balances). In our analysis, we will be focusing on stock-related investments, as we assume that: Historical Returns of Global Stocks vs Local Stocks (2001 – 2020) We first look at the historical annualized returns of global stocks vs local stocks, using MSCI All Country World Index and MSCI Singapore Index respectively (see table below). From here, we can see that long-term investors could potentially outperform 2.5% – 4% p.a., assuming that investment costs are kept low.  Source: Bloomberg, retrieved 10 February 2021 Historical performance aside, we do believe it pays off to invest globally for risk management purposes and not be fully invested in just the local stock market. This will help reduce country concentration risk, given that many of us have bulk of our wealth tied up in our residential property while our job security is also tied to Singapore’s fortunes. Factors to consider when thinking about whether it’s worth investing your CPF balance Looking solely at “average annualized returns” can be misleading, since an investor’s experience could differ quite materially. After all, we shouldn’t forget that there’s ~50% chance of underperforming the average. Thus, to evaluate whether it is worth investing your CPF balance, we approached the matter in this manner. First, shown below are the opportunity costs of investing your CPF monies. Logically, we should only invest our CPF balance if the stock market can give us a return that’s higher than these thresholds. Second, one investment option for one’s CPF balance is stock funds. As stock funds have annual fund management fees (usually 1.5% per annum), we’ll further consider return thresholds of 4.0% and 5.5%. We’d be interested in seeing what’s the probability of the stock index outperforming these higher thresholds. Third, we looked at the probability distribution of returns for MSCI All Country World Index and MSCI Singapore. Specifically, we retrieved data from the past 20 years, looked at ALL the 1-year periods within those 20 years (periods starting 31 December 2000 etc.), calculated the return for each of those 1-year periods, and then came up with the “probability distribution” of the returns. Don’t worry, it’s less work than it sounds. Lastly, we guessed that the “length of investment period” may affect the probability that we can surpass these return thresholds. So we repeated the above analysis across 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year periods as well. Probability Distribution of Stock Index Returns (2001 – 2020) In the below tables, we compiled the probability distribution of returns for the MSCI All Country World Index (global stocks) and the MSCI Singapore Index (local stocks), across varying 1, 3, 5, 10-year rolling time periods between 2001 to 2020.  For those who want to invest their CPF-OA monies, the stock index return thresholds to note are 2.5% and 4.0% (to factor in 1.5% p.a. of potential investment costs). Time in the market matters! Looking at the past twenty years of data, it does seem to imply that the longer you are invested in the market, the more likely you are to outperform the CPF-OA 2.5% interest rate.  Probability Distribution of 10-Year Stock Index Returns (2001 – 2020) In the below two charts, we illustrate the distribution of historical returns for global stock vs local stock returns, assuming a 10-year investment horizon. The horizontal x-axis shows the 10-year annualized return ranges, and the historical probability of getting a return within that range is written above each column. For example, looking at the leftmost red column in the first chart, we conclude that there was a 13% chance of MSCI All Country World Index returning 3 – 4% p.a. Long-term global stock investors generally outperformed CPF returns. For global stock investors with an investment horizon of 10 years or more, the likelihood of underperforming 2.5% – 4.0% p.a. returns in the past twenty years was low. Actual Return Distribution of CPFIS-OA Investors (Sep 2014 – Sep 2020) Based on statistics compiled by the CPF Board, the actual performance distribution from CPFIS-OA investors between Sep-2014 to Sep-2020 was: This means that 42% of individuals would have been better off, had they not invested their OA balances! The above statistic does not necessarily mean that investing your CPF monies is bad. Instead, individuals could potentially have been using the “wrong” investment vehicles, which are not aligned with the longer-term objectives of CPF. Later on in Section 4, we shortlist what we deem to be the “best” CPF-eligible investment vehicles. 3) We would only invest our excess CPF-OA balance To reiterate again, you should only invest your CPF monies if you are relatively confident of getting a better return than CPF interest rates (OA: 2.5% p.a. / SA: 4% p.a.). Would we invest our CPF-OA and CPF-SA? Personally, we’re NOT intending to invest our CPF SA balance for two reasons: For our CPF OA balance, we’re considering to invest it, with a view that stocks have a high probability of beating 2.5% p.a. over the longer-term (as we had discussed earlier in Section 2). Of course, it would be prudent to set aside what is needed for housing first, and investing the residual with this longer-term mindset. 4) Our shortlist of the best eligible investments for CPFIS-OA The full list of eligible investments for under CPFIS may be found here. Investing is a very personal matter and what is “best” for us may be different from what is “best” for you. That said, we have shortlisted four options (catering to different investment objectives) available under CPFIS-OA that is worth considering:  We provide more details on each of these options below. We do believe it pays off to invest globally and not be fully invested in just the local stock market. This will help reduce country concentration risk, given that many of us have bulk of our wealth tied up in our residential property while our job security is also tied to Singapore’s fortunes. 1) For Diversified SG Stock Exposure: SPDR Straits Times Index ETF The job of this ETF is simply to track the Straits Times Index, which consists of the largest 30 stocks listed on SGX. Do note that the index is largely skewed towards financial and property sector stocks, which comprise close to two-thirds of the index.   Source: Bloomberg, retrieved 12 February 2021 For more details on this ETF, you can refer to this link. 2) For Diversified Global Stock Exposure: Endowus Core Portfolio using CPF-OA (“Very Aggressive” – 100% Stocks) Endowus offers various core portfolios for CPF-OA to cater to different investor risk appetites. However, we have decided to focus on their “Very Aggressive” portfolio, as its 100% stock allocation could be suitable for long-term investors keen to maximize investment returns. Details on this portfolio may be found here. To summarize, the portfolio comprises of four unit trusts, two of which are low-cost passive tracker funds (that invest in global and US stocks), and the other two are actively managed funds (that invest in emerging market and Asia stocks). Such an allocation between the use of active vs passive vehicles is preferable in my view, given that low-cost passive investment vehicles (such as ETFs and passive tracker funds) have generally offered better performance for US stock exposure, on a net-of-fees basis. On the other hand, actively managed unit trusts have managed to do relatively better in offering non-US stock exposure (see this article for details). Details of the four underlying unit trusts used by Endowus is included in the tables below.   Source: Bloomberg, retrieved 12 February 2021 A benefit of using Endowus is its ability to keep investment costs low. For example, it is common practice for unit trust distribution platforms (such as FSM, DollarDex, POEMs, banks) to receive trailer fees from the unit trust manager (such as Blackrock, Schroders etc). Endowus receives these same trailer fees but passes it back fully to the investor! For CPF-funded portfolios, Endowus charges a flat 0.4% p.a. management fee., in addition to an approximate 0.71% p.a. blended net TER from the underlying four unit trusts. We believe this to be relatively cost-efficient, keeping in mind that there are no CPFIS-eligible low-cost global stock ETFs. 3) For Emerging Markets & Asia Stock Exposure: Selected Unit Trusts Previously, we had performed a fund screen to select the “best” SGD-denominated stock unit trusts. We filtered unit trusts that met the following criteria: The CPFIS-eligible stock unit trusts that met the above criteria include: We include details of these unit trusts in the below tables, with their relevant benchmarks where appropriate.   Source: Bloomberg, retrieved 12 February 2021. TER of the Fidelity Greater China Fund is an estimate. 4) For Active Local Stock Investors: SGX-listed stocks eligible under CPFIS Some investors may prefer to select their own SGX-listed stocks for their CPF investment portfolio. The full list of eligible SGX-listed stocks may be found in this link. Summary of where you can purchase these CPFIS investment products In the table below, we summarize the geographical stock exposures of the shortlisted investment options and where these products may be purchased at. Do note that you may be able to purchase these specific unit trusts on other platforms that we have not mentioned.  For the selected unit trusts that are available on the Endowus platform, Endowus happens to be the cheapest way to purchase them. The purchase can be done via a recently launched product offering called “Endowus Fund Smart”, which allows investors to select their own unit trusts (from a list that has been curated by Endowus). We had also published an article previously on this new offering (article link), if you are keen to find out more. The InvestQuest View We believe it’s worth investing the portion of our CPF-OA balance that’s in excess of our housing needs, especially if the investment horizon is 10 years or more. Regarding what to invest in, we believe that higher-risk assets such as stocks would be the most appropriate, given the relatively high historical probability of beating the 2.5% p.a. CPF-OA interest rate over periods of at least 5 – 10 years. Lastly, we summarize the “best” investment vehicles that we would consider for our own CPF-OA investments.

However, the Tiger Brokers app also has several features that make Tiger Brokers stand out from its peers. Here are 5 useful features to help first-time Singapore investors and traders get started on their investing journey. #1 Access To US, Singapore, Hong Kong And China Markets Within One App Beyond just Singapore, Tiger Brokers offers access to key overseas markets that many Singapore investors and traders would want to participate in. You get access to financial markets in Australia, China, Hong Kong and the US. With US stocks making up over 54% of world stocks, this is more than sufficient for a first-time investor or trader. Tiger Brokers provides access to Chinese A-shares through the Shanghai-Hong Kong and Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect. For investors who are keen on Chinese companies, this is a boon as it gives you access to China stocks that are not listed on US or Hong Kong exchanges. What really sets Tiger Brokers apart from other brokers is that they go the extra mile to help first-time investors and traders by offering free live price data. This is in contrast to most other brokers that are only able to offer free delayed pricing unless you sign up for the subscriptions to upgrade to live data. Instead, Tiger Brokers offer free live prices for US and Singapore markets and basic market price (BMP) for China and Hong Kong markets. BMP delivers live prices upon refresh (and you can initiate the refresh simply by scrolling on the app). Having live prices makes a lot of difference whether you are looking to trade or invest long term! #2 Explore New Stocks, News and Data With The Discover Feature With the thousands of companies listed on the available stock markets, individual stock selection can be a bewildering choice. For first time investors and traders looking to venture beyond the realm of index funds and blue-chip stocks, Tiger Brokers’ Discover feature can be an amazing wealth of information. Under the Discover tab, investors and traders can search for new stocks by common metrics such as volume, percentage movement and more interestingly, by technical data such as similar candlestick charts. For traders or investors who want to rely on technical analysis and candlestick charting to choose their stocks and to time their entry/exit, this is an innovative way of stock selection as you can use the chart of an existing stock that you already like and may have invested in, to find other stocks that are showing similar candlestick chart characteristics.  Discover > Hot > Similar (Similar Candlestick Chart Searching) Additionally, the Discover feature also has a Calendar section that shows major events, dividend dates, earnings and financial report releases and IPO calendar. For investors and traders who rely on news, this is a convenient resource to keep track of stock-related news. Major economic data such as US nonfarm payrolls and unemployment rate are also easily accessed under the Discover feature.  Discover > Calendar #3 Get Quantitative Strategies With Tiger Lab If you believe in a data driven approach towards investing and trading, you will definitely enjoy Tiger Brokers’ Tiger Lab. Here, the quantitative team at Tiger Broker showcases unique quantitative investment strategies such as growth momentum strategy, super hunter long and quant optimization. The real value with Tiger Lab is that they disclose the entry and exit of each of the stock selected. Not only can you see the performance of the investment strategy, but you can also replicate the strategy by keeping track of the entries and exits of the various positions. In particular, quant optimization gives you a detailed record of the strategy’s position changes by the day.  Discover > Hot > Tiger Lab > Quant Optimization #4 (Free) Access To Data To Improve Your Stock Analysis The Tiger Brokers App makes data accessible to even first-time investors and traders in the form of clearly presented stock data, optimised for mobile access. For traders who rely on technical indicators, you can easily apply indicators such as relative strength index (RSI), Bollinger bands, Moving Averages (MA), Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) to any stock chart, even if you are out and about.  Investors who rely on fundamental analysis will appreciate the depth of data that Tiger Brokers pulls together in their analysis. You can find information regarding the company’s financials: income statement, balance sheet, cash flow clearly presented in graphical charts allowing to quickly evaluate information, instead of trawling through the company’s annual report.  #5 Lively Trading News and Community To Keep In Touch With The Market Sentiment One of the things that most first-time investors and traders may not realise is the importance of a community. Not only does being part of a like-minded community accelerate your learning through the experiences of others, but the community interaction also keeps you tuned to the market sentiment. Regardless of whether you are an investor or a trader, the stock market has its biases and knowing the market sentiment will help you in managing your own portfolio. Tiger Broker App’s community feature allows you to discuss trading news with like-minded traders, share investing strategies and follow stock market-related news. You can also post your own thoughts about a particular stock as part of your own learning journey and receive feedback from others. In addition to the in-app community, Tiger Brokers also has an active Telegram chat group and Instagram feed (@tigerbrokerssg) that you can follow and interact with others.  Community > News  Tiger Brokers Telegram And Instagram In addition to the features mentioned above, Tiger Brokers also prizes convenience to its users, in form of its feature-filled mobile app and in its deposit processing. For example, Tiger Brokers customers can choose to utilise the Direct Debit Authorisation (DDA) with DBS to make their investing process hassle free. This way, instead of having to transfer the funds manually from your bank account to your Tiger Brokers Account, the DDA allows you to initiate the deposit within Tiger Brokers and the bank (DBS) will execute the deposit for you. The funds will be transferred within minutes if the transfer is initiated within banking hours. So, each time you buy stocks on Tiger Broker, you don’t need to log in separately to your internet banking account to transfer the funds into Tiger Brokers. Everything can be done within the Tiger Brokers App. If you are interested to check out these feature and open an account with Tiger Brokers, you can sign up for Tiger Brokers here.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING Why ESG Investing Should Matter To Singaporeans Sustainable investing isn’t just good for the environment. It can be good for you as an investor. by This article was contributed to us by Endowus. Sustainable investing, or ESG investing, is an important and positive trend that will lead to a better future for humanity. Just a few years ago, it wouldn’t have occurred to us to think about how our investment decisions could shape the world. For far too long, a company’s net negative impact on the world didn’t matter as it was focused solely on maximising profits. But as we increasingly witness how unsustainable corporate actions can have adverse and long-term effects on the environment and society, investors today are challenging the status quo and asking a vital question: How do we stay sustainable while investing? This question has spurred more and more investors to put their money towards sustainable investments—companies that are staying accountable and addressing their impact on the world and the future of our society. In fact, the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment reported that the total AUM for US-domiciled sustainable investments grew by 42% (from US$12 trillion to US$17.1 trillion) between 2018 and 2020 alone. But what exactly is sustainable or ESG investing? And why should ESG investing matter to you? We’ll get into that here. What is ESG investing? The most immediate thought that comes to mind when you think about sustainability is environmental protection. While environmental issues get the most media attention, ESG investors also look at two other components when assessing sustainability: social and governance. These three components make up the ESG acronym. In addition to using traditional investment methodologies, ESG investors often factor ESG issues in their evaluation of a particular investment and their construction of the portfolio. Here’s a breakdown of each component:  Though these three components are distinct in their own right, they often overlap in their outcome. For instance, a company that’s transparent and has good corporate governance (G) will likely also work to ensure that it stays accountable to the public (S) and the public’s health by minimising its environmental impact (E). The end result? An ESG company will more likely have a net positive impact on the world. Why ESG investing should matter to Singaporeans For Singaporean investors, ESG considerations should matter even more. Beyond just thinking about your retirement, as long-term investors, you would also think about what the world would look like when you hit retirement 30, 40, or even 50 years down the line. Possibly the most pressing concern is the impact of climate change on Singapore. Data from the Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS) indicate that Singapore could see average daily temperatures rise by 1.4℃ to 4.6℃, more intense and frequent rainfall, and average sea levels rise up to 1 meter in about 80 years. Between now and 80 years later, increased temperatures can cause a whole host of issues for Singaporeans; we would increasingly need to use more energy to cool the city, the country’s biodiversity could be affected, and diseases such as dengue could be harder to manage. Not to mention, the rising sea levels pose an imminent threat in the low-lying areas of the country. Though we may not feel it now, these problems will cost us more—both as a nation and individually—in the long run, if they aren’t managed properly now. Singapore’s investment in a sustainable future Thankfully Singapore, as a nation, is placing a strong emphasis on sustainability. In 2021, the government unveiled the Singapore Green Plan 2030. The plan commits to the Paris Agreement and the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda with the goal to achieve long-term net-zero carbon emissions. As part of the plan, the government plans to issue green bonds on public sector green projects, with around S$19 billion of projects already identified. One thing is clear: Singapore aims to be the regional centre for sustainable finance, and this can be a catalyst to enable more sustainable development in the country and beyond. Besides issuing green bonds, the government will also directly invest in environmental initiatives—setting aside S$60 million for locally-produced food, S$50 million for community-led environmental projects, and S$30 million for EV-related initiatives, planting 1 million more trees, greening 80% of Singapore buildings, and expanding the rail network. All these initiatives point to the fact that Singapore is taking sustainability seriously, and investors have plenty of opportunities to be at the forefront of this incredible change. Influencing change through ESG investing Despite Singapore’s attempts to mitigate environmental risks, companies and governments in other countries may not be taking similar steps to slow climate change. For instance, if other countries increase their carbon emissions while we’re reducing our own emissions, our effort is cancelled out. In other words, climate change really does require a global effort. The global pandemic also shone a light on some glaring ESG issues globally. Public health and sanitation (E), employee well-being, income inequality and diversity (S), and corporate regulation (G) were some of the big talking points of the year. So, what can you do as an investor? That’s where ESG investing comes in. Your capital and where you decide to invest it can influence companies’ decisions. If you choose to avoid companies that undermine ESG efforts (this is known as negative screening) and if you then choose to invest in companies that are integrating ESG into their decision-making and business practices (known as positive screening), you’re basically telling companies and investment funds that you want them to be accountable to their actions. The more investors demand accountability, the more likely we’re able to impact ESG changes in corporations. This means we can influence companies to reduce their carbon emissions, enhance their labour protection and employees’ rights, or ensure that their board members act in the best interest of their stakeholders. Many fund managers are starting to enable investors to drive change. ESG funds, in particular, go out of their way to ensure their investments meet their high sustainability standards. For instance, leading funds like Schroder ISF Global Sustainable Growth Fund and Mirova Global Sustainable Equity Fund employ disciplined investment processes through holistic ESG analysis. The funds assess companies based on their long-term impact on all stakeholders including employees, the environment, suppliers, customers, regulators, and so on. Using proprietary ESG metrics, the funds evaluate companies on key sustainability-related issues, and only companies that pass the rigorous ESG assessment are considered for investment. How ESG can improve your portfolio’s performance One upside to the growing trend towards ESG is that now you don’t have to choose between sustainability and potential returns. Many funds factor ESG as a risk management enhancement to address the evolving global systemic risks. In other words, having ESG investments can help reduce your risk while also giving you the opportunity to earn a better return. Think about it: Companies that fail to recognise the ESG challenges we face today can impede their own growth. And companies that make the effort to be more sustainable are future-proofing themselves, and are ultimately better positioned for growth. As evidenced by the S&P 500 ESG Index outperforming the S&P 500 Index in 2020 during the pandemic, companies with a reliable ESG track record were more resilient than their non-ESG counterparts. At the time of writing, the S&P 500 ESG Index has outperformed the S&P 500 Index by 0.67% on a 1-year total return basis and 1.22% on a 3-year total return basis.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING How We Can Use OCBC RoboInvest To Start Our Investment Journey In 2021 You can invest in a portfolio of precious metals including gold and silver from as little as US$100. by This article was written in collaboration with OCBC. All views expressed in this article are the independent opinion of DollarsAndSense.sg based on our research. DollarsAndSense.sg is not liable for any financial losses that may arise from any transactions and readers are encouraged to do their own due diligence. You can view our full editorial policy here. With the introduction of the Singapore Financial Data Exchange (SGFinDex) in December 2020, Singaporeans can now use our  SingPass to retrieve personal financial information from CPF, HDB, IRAS and the 7 participating banks in Singapore. This is useful, because it allows us to consolidate all our financial information on one platform. It also means that regardless of who you choose to bank and invest with, we see find our financial information on a single platform such as OCBC’s Financial OneView. With financial markets currently performing better than expected especially given the pandemic, it’s not a surprise that many people want to start investing in 2021. One such way to start our investment journey is via robo-advisory platforms such as OCBC’s RoboInvest. We first wrote about the OCBC RoboInvest when it was first launched 2 years ago. Since then, RoboInvest has expanded the range of investment portfolios it offers to Singapore investors. In an increasingly crowded robo-advisory space in Singapore, investors would naturally wonder what are  the similarities and differences between the various platforms and which one suits them best. The good news is that whether you are an existing or new investor, OCBC RoboInvest can be a suitable platform for you to use for your investment portfolio. OCBC RoboInvest Allows You To Choose Your Investment Portfolio One of the differentiating factor of OCBC RoboInvest compared to other robo-advisory platforms is that it allows us to choose the portfolios that we want to invest in. As an investor, OCBC RoboInvest allows us to choose from 34 thematic portfolios of equities and exchange traded funds (ETFs) across 6 markets. These include common themes such as US Tech Leaders, Stable US Consumer Giants or China Growth as well as more specific ones such as Gen-Z Winners, US Cloud Computing or Impact Investing. The minimum investment amount starts from as little as US$100 and goes up to HK$350,000, depending on which portfolio we choose to invest. As an investor, we can choose the sector that you want to invest in. For example, if we want to invest in U.S. tech companies, we can choose to invest in the US Tech Leaders Portfolio. This is great, especially for new investors, who may be keen to invest in equities but who do not yet have the experience to pick single stocks. Investing in a portfolio of equities and ETFs provides diversification.  As you can see from the screenshot above, the minimum investment amount for the portfolio is US$4,000. More significantly, OCBC also tells us the risk levels associated with each portfolio. For those of us who are not willing to take high risks, it’s advisable that we choose a lower-risk portfolio. We can do this by using the filter to narrow down our selection of portfolios. In the example below, we set our risk level to ‘Medium’.  Getting Started On Investing With OCBC RoboInvest As an existing OCBC Digital Banking user, getting started on investing through OCBC RoboInvest is easy. We can invest via internet banking or the OCBC Mobile Banking app (which you can download on the App Store or Google Play). In our case, we used the OCBC Mobile Banking App. All screenshots below are taken from the OCBC Mobile Banking app. Step 1: Open the dashboard on our OCBC Mobile Banking App. Select Invest  Step 2: Select RoboInvest. We can also try out other investment platforms such as Unit Trusts and Blue Chip Investment Plan.  Step 3: We can choose if we are new to investing or an experienced investor. In our case, we selected experienced investor.  Step 4: Choose the portfolio we wish to invest in. You can scroll through all the 34 different portfolios that RoboInvest currently offers. For this article, we decided to invest in Precious Metals as this is not offered by any other robo-advisory platforms in Singapore. The minimum investment amount for this portfolio is US$100. This is NOT a recommendation or financial advice from DollarsAndSense. Please do your own due diligence on what is appropriate for you to invest in.  Step 5: After selecting the portfolio, we will see further information about the investment such as its past performance, and allocation and constituents.  Step 6: Choose the amount we wish to invest. If the investment has to be made in foreign currency, OCBC will automatically do the foreign currency conversion for us. In our case, the minimum was US$100 which converts to S$136. We will be asked which OCBC savings account we wish to deduct the investment amount from.  Step 7: Review and confirm the investment  After we have confirmed the investment, our trade will be executed by the next working day.  If we wish to invest more, whether it’s in a similar or different portfolio, we can do so anytime. Also, we can withdraw our investment at any point in time without incurring any transaction cost.

We can do it on your laptop/desktop at home, on our mobile phone via OCBC mobile banking if we are out and about. Since OCBC is a bank that most of us already have a savings account with, it’s convenient as the funds for our investments can be deducted directly from our designated OCBC deposit accounts, rather than for us to need to make a fund transfer to an external platform or brokerage. This makes it much easier for us make investing a regular habit. In addition, with investment from as little as US$100, it’s easy for us to adopt a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) approach to investing. To be clear, just because the investment can be done easily within minutes doesn’t mean we do not need to do our own research. As the investor, we have to decide which are the sectors that we are confident of investing in. A platform such as the OCBC RoboInvest can help us gain exposure to the sectors we want to invest in, so that we do not have to worry about which are the right stocks or ETFs to invest in. But ultimately, the decision on which sector we want exposure to still remains with us. 4 STOCKS THIS WEEK Singtel (Z74); StarHub (CC3); NetLink (CJLU): Local Telcos Dividend Yield And Share Price Performance BRANDED CONTENT Cashback Vs Miles: How To Enjoy The Best Of Both Worlds MONEY Complete Guide To Multi-Currency Accounts And Wallets In Singapore [YouTrip, Revolut, Wise, DBS My Account, UOB Mighty FX And More] INSIGHTS 7 International Rankings That Singaporeans Enjoy PROPERTY En Bloc Deal: 3 Ways You Can Still Not Make Any Money COLUMNS 8 Things You Need To Know Before Heading To The Money Changer BRANDED CONTENT Why Homeowners Should Avoid Overspending on Their HDB Flats MONEY 11 Joints Savings Account To Open With Your Spouse Or Parents BONDS AND FIXED INCOME Step By Step Guide To Buying T-Bills Online Using Your CPF OA Savings ESTATE GUIDE Neighbourhood Estate Guide: Rediscovering Jurong East, The Regional Centre Of The West                     Copyright © 2019 DollarsAndSense. \n",

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING Step-By-Step Guide To Opening An Account And Investing Through Singapore-Based Robo-Advisor StashAway We set up our account in less than 10 minutes. by StashAway is a robo-advisor that helps investors gain investment exposure to global equities without having to spend the time and effort to monitor their portfolio. And why not. We increasingly rely on technology to simplify many daily activities in our lives today – from knowing exactly when the bus will arrive at the bus-stop to keeping in touch with our family and friends 24/7 to getting our favourite dinner served to us at our doorstep after a long day at work. Why Should We Invest Via A Robo-Advisor In Singapore? TLDR: Long version: Today, there are more than 10 robo-advisor platforms in Singapore that we can invest our money with. Robo-advisors simplify our long-term investment needs by providing a digital platform to automate our investments and portfolio management. In essence, the rise of its popularity is mainly because it takes over much of the heavy lifting work for investors. Using complex algorithms, robo-advisors are able to simplify the process of assessing an individual’s risk profile, select a suitable and diversified basket of investments catered to the individual and manage his or her investment portfolio through market and lifecycles. This reduces any instances of conflicts of interest that a human financial advisor may introduce, plugs potential knowledge gaps that many younger, inexperienced or uninterested investors may have as well as even out the playing field by offering access to professional portfolio management via its complex algorithms. A robo-advisor’s algorithms not only put investors on equal footing, it also minimises human intervention within its entire value chain, and thereby reducing cost for its investors via lower management fees. That being said, most robo-advisors still offer good customer service support and employ highly skilled fund managers and programmers. What’s even better is that robo-advisors may also offer no minimum investment amount, no lock-up of funds and no withdrawal (sales) charges. Finally, even though robo-advisories are newcomers, they are rapidly adapting to customers’ requirements by offering more products. For example, StashAway also provides a cash management account – StashAway Simple – in addition to its investment solution. Apart from investing in its goal-based portfolio, we can also choose to invest in its income portfolio. We can also invest our SRS funds in the portfolios. We decide to test out Singapore-based StashAway to find out easy (or difficult) it is to start out, and what we can expect in terms of service standards and investment methodologies. Below is a walkthrough of our sign-up process, complete with screenshots and learnings. Opening A StashAway Account StashAway was founded in 2016 and operates under the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s Capital Market Services Licence (CMS100604-1). StashAway uses a proprietary investment strategy based on the theory of economic cycles, Economic Regime-based Asset Allocation, or ERAATM. This enables it to monitor economic trends and valuations to rebalance its customers’ asset allocation mix for the long-term. StashAway charges a fee of between 0.2% to 0.8% per year, depending on the amount that we have invested. Currently, StashAway is giving 50% off its management fees for 6 months, for up to $50,000 in portfolio value. You can sign up here after reading this walkthrough. Read Also: How Singapore Robo-Advisor StashAway Invests Your Money: Economic Regime-Based Asset Allocation (ERAA) On the sign-up page for DollarsAndSense readers, you also read more about StashAway’s investment methodology, its unique features and gain useful financial insights, as well as receive exclusive sign-up perks. Here’s a step-by-step guide to opening an account:  Visit: I went ahead to “Get Started”. First, I had to fill in some personal information about myself. Many platforms require such information, and moreover, robo-advisors’ algorithms need this to do its job assessing my risk profile and recommending a suitable investment basket for me. It even highlights this at the bottom of the screen.  It then asked me if we want to invest for a life goal. This was a natural choice, as I think we should always try to save for a life goal. If you’re unsure, you can hit this option to look at some life goals you choose to start investing for. Otherwise, hitting “General Investing” is fine, as you’ll still be able to change this option later on.  I picked to start to “Plan For My Retirement”. Of course, you can pick more than one goal to invest for if you want! Personally, I also have a toddler and may want to start saving for his education in about 20 years.  Even if I had no clue how to start planning for my retirement or how much I would actually need, StashAway provides a simple calculator to kickstart this process. There’s also an option if I “already know how much I need”.  Based on my needs, I needed close to $790,000 for my retirement, or to invest $570 each month. We can invest with cash or even choose to put in our SRS funds. Read Also: Supplementary Retirement Scheme – 4 Things You Need To Understand Before Opening An SRS Account  Some of the entries in the calculator were pre-filled, and I left those as they were. I’m taking a guess that the algorithms did some math to arrive at those figures. I did increase my retirement age to 70, as I believe people will be expected to work till later in their lives, especially with modern medicine and the rising cost of living. The government is already announced that they will be increasing the retirement age to 65 and re-employment age to 70 by around 2030, so it’s not far-fetched for us to work till 70. I was asked for how much I expected to receive in CPF LIFE payouts. This may be tricky for people who haven’t started planning for retirement. You may want to read this Beginners’ Guide for CPF LIFE and Monthly CPF LIFE payouts when you retire in Singapore to get a better understanding of this. I selected $1,350, as this was the amount I can expect to receive on the Standard Plan if I saved up to the Full Retirement Sum. I left the final two entries at $0 because I don’t have another retirement savings or plans currently. I guess it’s a good thing I decided to start investing with StashAway today! I received two results: a chart and a portfolio composition.  In the chart, I could basically tell that if I invested $570 diligently every month until I turn 70, I would have close to $1.29 million for my retirement. This exceeds my required amount. Reading the fine prints on the bottom left, I realised this was because there’s a 90% probability I would end up in the green shaded area. This could be significantly lower than the $1.29 million mark. At the lower-end of the range is my $800,000 target. So, there’s a 90% chance I’ll end up with around $800,000 or more for my retirement.  In the second result, I gained some insights into how my monthly investments would be invested. Interestingly, almost half of it will be invested in fixed income (such as bonds). Close to a third will be in equities, about 15% in hybrid funds and the rest in commodities. This looks like a well-diversified, albeit very safe, investment. My goal to “Plan for Retirement” is done. To proceed investing towards this goal, I now need to set up my account.  Here, there are three sub-sections: 1) personal information, 2) basic financial assessment and 3) verify your identity via uploading your NRIC.  Next, we need to “confirm investments”.  When I click the green “Review Portfolio” button, I will get to view my: # 1 Portfolio Summary  Here, I can see my “StashAway Risk Index”. This defines the potential loss of a given portfolio, which means there is a 99% chance that the maximum amount I lose on my portfolio is 14.0%. This is because of the risk level I’m willing to take. In green, the words “Adjust Risk” allows us to take on riskier or less risky investments.  # 2 Portfolio Composition  Here, I can tell my portfolio is being invested quite evenly in growth and protective (or defensive) investments. To view the investments, we have to look below, at the exact asset allocation. # 3 Asset Allocation  This shows me exactly what I will be investing in and what weight it will hold within my portfolio. We can presume that these investments have selected by the algorithm based on my prior inputs. These investments are also primarily exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from around the world.

There is no minimum amount in Singapore dollars (SGD) transfers, but there is a US$10,000 minimum for US dollars (USD) transfers.  Next, I have to indicate the one-time transfer, as well as the subsequent monthly transfers I want to make. My decision is be to stick to the $570 transfers each month.  I also have to indicate that I want to make subsequent monthly transfers of $570 as well.  Finally, I will need to actually make the transfer from my bank account. StashAway will provide a unique reference code that I need to use, for them to recognise it came from me.  Now, I’m all set, and ready to start accumulating my retirement nest egg. And if you follow the same steps like I did, you too would be well on your way to investing your wealth for the future.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING Why Do Many Singaporeans Perform Poorly Investing In The Stock Market? Don’t put all your eggs in one (Singapore) basket by As I reflect on the happenings of 2020, the one thing that troubles me most was the number of people asking me for financial advice because their investment portfolio had performed poorly.  I am especially perturbed as many of them are ordinary people with extraordinary (and avoidable) losses in the stock market. After listening to the many sob stories from fellow investors based in Singapore, I can list four reasons for their poor market performance: #1 Overconcentration in Singapore Economy/ Stocks Many Singaporean investors have the majority of their investments in stocks listed in Singapore.  According to Bloomberg, the Singapore stock market is officially the worst performing one in Asia. If you were to look at the chart above, in 2020, the Singapore stock market, represented by the Straits Times Index (STI), is the worst performing compared to the major stock market indices across the world. Many Singapore stocks listed in SGX simply do not perform well.  Over the last 6 years, de-listings have outnumbered new listings, and the market capitalisation has been shrinking. Some of our best Singapore companies such as Razer and SEA Group (Shopee) chose to list in Hong Kong or US, where the valuations sought are much higher than SGX.

With the declining quantity and quality of stocks listed on the SGX, how would Singapore investors do well in investing in stocks in SGX? To make matters worse, very few Singaporean investors diversify their stocks investment in other markets. By putting all their eggs into one terrible basket, when COVID-19 hit the world in 2020, many Singaporean investors were badly affected. #2 Costly Love for Dividends and Blue Chip Singapore Stocks Singaporean investors are largely risk-averse and dividend-seeking. Ideally, they would want a stock that has strong growth, high dividends and sound capital protection. Such stocks simply do not exist; you cannot have your cake and eat it.  Growth stocks do not pay good dividends, while dividends stocks usually have limited growth potential. Given their need for certainty of investment gains, most Singaporean investors end up preferring high-dividends instruments like REITs and dividend paying blue-chip stocks.

In the face of a major business disruption from competition or the external environment, the high dividend paying company would have little “dry powder” to face the challenge head-on. The COVID-19 crisis has burst many Singapore investors’ dream for dividends. Many blue-chip stocks are bruised to “blue-black” stocks.  Many REITS are also cutting their Distribution Per Unit (DPU).  To make matters worst, many of the “blue-chip” companies are in industries that are facing major permanent disruptions. For example: SPH’s advertising business is disrupted by Google and Facebook. Telcos like Singtel, M1 and Starhub are disrupted by communication applications like WhatsApp, Wechat and Telegram. Banks like DBS, OCBC and UOB are facing disruptions from digital banks and the rise of Fintech. Focusing on dividends could cause you to miss out on companies that are leading the market growth. Highly profitable US-listed companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook, Berkshire Hathaway do not issue dividends. Yet, their share prices have skyrocketed over the years. Non-dividend paying stocks could make you more money and are likely to be more resilient to competition and external shocks. #3 Being Fearful When Others Are Fearful Warren Buffet immortalised this quote: “Be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful”. Yet many Singapore investors do just the opposite. During the market crash of March & April 2020, a huge opportunity presented itself when the US Federal Reserve announced unlimited Quantitative Easing to support the market. I published an article “Why I Believe A Big Stock Market Bull Run Is Coming, Despite The Current COVID-19 Crisis” and posted a video telling everyone that a major US market bull-run was coming. Instead, many investors passed the chance as they felt that the market would continue to fall and they didn’t want to catch a falling knife.  Of course, they all missed the investment opportunity of a lifetime – for being fearful when others are fearful. #4 Being Greedy When Others Are Greedy Now that the market has recovered strongly and sentiments are bullish, many people are entering (and jumping into) the market. Many are treating the stock market like a casino.  I shudder as I hear more ordinary people (such as hawkers, national service boys, aunties and uncles) talking about the stock market in public these days. This is a strong signal of a growing stock market bubble to me. Many Singapore investors buy stocks based on hearsay, market rumours, analyst reports, online recommendations, or some technical analysis charts. Many are dangerously dabbling into Bitcoin, Forex, Options and Futures with very little knowledge of what these instruments are and the risks they carry.  I have seen this phenomenon again and again for more than 2 decades – Asia Financial Crisis (1997), Dot.com bust (2001), Global Financial Crisis (2008) and China Stock Market Crash (2015).  I am almost certain that this blind euphoria will end up in a terrible blood bath for many Singaporean investors. What Should Investors in Singapore do? For most Singaporean investors, I would like to reiterate this: to do well in stock market investments, you could adopt a simple 3- step strategy: 1. Set up a financial safety net with a 1M65 (or better yet, 4M65) CPF strategy. With a million-dollar financial safety net, you would be able to better react emotionally to market turbulences, especially buying on market crashes, instead of panicking. 2. Diversification outside of Singapore. As a Singaporean, your property, savings, job and CPF are already based in Singapore. By over-investing in the Singapore stock market, you are dangerously putting all your eggs in one basket. Consider investments in other markets, e.g. US or Asia etc. 3. Adopt a compounding strategy, e.g. Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) into the S&P 500 or NASDAQ 100, and holding it for a long time. The S&P 500 has grown at an average rate of 8% – 10% annually over the last century. Putting $1 into it would likely more than double its value in a decade and quadruple in two decades.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING Lump Sum VS DCA: How Much Would You Have Made (Or Lost) If You Started Investing In January 2020 The STI would have earned you a positive return in 2020 if you invested via a DCA approach each month. by As we enter 2021, some of us will have resolutions that appear similar to what we had in 2020. One of these resolutions could be to start our investment journey in 2021. This led us to think: for those of us who made this resolution to start investing in January 2020, how would we have fared for the year? After all, 2020 was easily the worst year that the world has experienced in recent history, with millions of lives lost, billions of people affected, and also one of the worst stock markets crash in years. To help us assess how our investments could have panned out in 2020, we assume that an individual had $10,000 to invest at the start of 2020. The individual could have chosen to 1) invest in one lump sum, which means $10,000 in January 2020, or 2) use a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) method to invest $833.33 each month for 12 consecutive months. For this article, we simply assume that the investor could have invested in one of two broad-based market indexes – the S&P 500 or the Strait Times Index (STI). #1 Lump Sum Investment of $10,000 On January 2020 Into The S&P 500 On 2 January 2020, the S&P 500 was at 3,257.85. If you had invested $10,000 on that day, you would have suffered a loss of about 31.3% by 23 March 2020. This means your portfolio would be worth only $6,870 on that day. You would felt incredibly unlucky at that point in time, given that you have lost close to 1/3 of your portfolio value in less than 3 months. However, if you held on to your investment till 31 December 2020, you would be sitting on profits for 2020. This is because the S&P 500 recovered to close the year at 3,756.07, up about 15.3%. Your $10,000 investment at the start of 2020 would be worth about $11,530 as of 31 December 2020. #2 Lump Sum Investment of $10,000 On January 2020 Into The Straits Times Index (STI) On 2 January 2020, the STI was at 3,252. If you invested $10,000 on that day, you would have suffered a loss of about 28.2% by 23 March 2020, when the STI hit 2,333.48. At that point, your portfolio would be worth about $7,180. If you held on to your investment till 31 December 2020, your initial investment of $10,000 in the STI at the start of the year would be worth about $8,740 as of 31 December 2020. This represents a loss of approximately 12.6% for 2020. Note: The calculation above does not take into consideration foreign exchange currency, transaction cost and dividend income At its lowest on 23 March 2020, the STI didn’t fall as much as the S&P 500. However, while the STI is still showing a loss of about 12.6% as of 31 December 2020, investors for the S&P 500 are sitting on a gain of about 15.3% as of 31 December 2020. Read Also: How Much Would Singapore Investors Have Made If They Invested $1,000 In Every REIT ETF Since Their Listing? Would A Dollar-Cost Average (DCA) Approach Be Better? We were curious about how a DCA strategy would have worked in 2020. After all, the idea behind DCA is that we invest the same amount of money each month so that we buy fewer units when prices are high, and more units when prices are low. #3 DCA In 2020 For S&P 500 Here’s how the calculation for the S&P 500 turned out if we invested $833.33 each month. Do note that the S&P price level each month we took is based on the index’s closing price on the first trading day for each month.   From the table above, we can see that an investor who invested $10,000 over 12 months ($833.33 per month) would not only have a portfolio ($11,902) that is worth more than an investor who invested at the start of the year ($11,530) but would also suffer less of a shock on 23 March 2020 when the market was at its lowest point. #4 DCA In 2020 For Straits Times Index (STI) The natural assumption that most people have is that investing in the STI in 2020 would have resulted in a loss. After all, the STI is down about for 2020. However, this is based on the assumption that an investor made a lump sum investment in January 2020. If instead of investing a lump sum at the start of 2020, the intention was to invest an equal sum each month into the STI, how would we have fared in 2020?   The calculation above is based on the index’s closing price on the first trading day for each month. This may come as a surprise to some but had an investor committed to a DCA strategy in 2020, his STI portfolio would be worth about $10,657 as of 31 December 2020, or a gain of about 6.6% for the year. This is pretty impressive since the general sentiment among investors is that the STI is one of the worst-performing markets for the year. However, as you can see, an investor who used a  DCA approach would have made profits in 2020 investing in the STI. Do note that our calculation does not take into consideration transaction costs and dividend income. Is A Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) Strategy Necessarily Better Than A Lump Sum Investment? Based on the findings of this article, a DCA strategy may appear superior compared to a lump sum investment. However, this is not always the case. In the event of a bull-run, investors would be better off using a lump-sum investment strategy so that as much capital is being deployed, as quickly as possible. This allows investors to maximise their gains in the market. However, in a high volatility period such as what we witnessed in 2020, a DCA strategy is preferable since it allows us to pick up more units when prices are low and fewer units when prices are high. At the same time, we also avoid the fear of seeing our portfolio lose a sizeable chunk of its value in a short period. In fact, as seen in the example of a DCA approach towards investing in the STI, investors could have even made profits in 2020 even though the index was underperforming.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING 101 You Don’t Have To Be Rich Or Own A Fortune To Start Investing A small amount is enough to start a change by This article was contributed to us by AIA Singapore. In your daily lives, you may be coping with paying off your bills and managing your living expenses each month. By the end of every month, you may find yourself in need of your salary to keep up with your day-to-day living expenditure. Thus, the idea of setting aside money each month to invest may be a distant afterthought. However, it’s also a common misconception that you need to be rich or have a lot of savings before you can start investing. This isn’t true, especially with the diverse options available when it comes to investing today. Start With Saving Up First The first goal you need to work towards is spending less than you earn each month. By doing this, you will create a saving buffer to take care of emergency expenses. Soon, you will realise that just saving alone will not be enough. In order to grow your savings at a rate that’s faster than the inflation rate, you need to invest. Once you build a large enough emergency fund, you can start thinking about investing your excess savings. How To Begin Investing With Just A Little Money? Again, you don’t have to have a lot of money to start investing. By regularly contributing a small sum of money towards investing each month, you can start building a tidy nest egg for yourself. This strategy is commonly termed as Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA). By embarking on a DCA investment strategy, you benefit from: #1 Starting With A Small Amount While having a large sum of savings to plough into the markets may be an ideal scenario, the reality is that not everyone starts off rich or with a fortune to invest. Even if you had a large lump sum of money to invest, doing so via a DCA strategy can help you sleep better at night. By investing at regular intervals, you are limiting the risk of investing at the wrong time, simply due to bad luck. The DCA strategy works best when you regularly put investments, regardless of how small, into the market to help you achieve the best possible outcome in the long-term. By putting away a smaller sum each month, you may also find it easier and less of a pinch to divert the amount from your monthly salary. #2 Avoiding Market Timing Markets can be notoriously hard to predict. Being a relatively new investor, you should assume that you cannot make savvier investment decisions than investment professionals. There are also countless research findings that show even the experts fail in being able to time the markets accurately. Utilising a DCA strategy encourages you to invest a fixed amount of money each month, regardless of whether markets go up or down. The result will be that you bought more investment units when prices are low, and less investment units when prices are higher. This effectively allowed you to invest at the “average” price, and enable you to earn the market return. #3 Taking A Disciplined Approach By investing each month, whether the markets were on a bull or bear charge, you substitute emotions for consistency. This helps you take a more disciplined approach towards investing. Cons Of Dollar Cost Averaging Every strategy has its pros and cons. Looking at the positives, you may think that applying the DCA strategy is a sure-win strategy. While it increases your chances, especially over a long time horizon, you have to note that every investment carries some form of risk. One disadvantage of the DCA strategy is that if you are able to identify the right investments or investment themes, getting in as early as possible with as much of your money as possible can help you achieve better outcomes. If you have a large sum of money, your spending power may diminish while you apply the DCA strategy of making only periodic investments into the market, and keeping the bulk of your funds outside of any investments. Just like with every other financial decision, you need to assess your financial situation and make the best decision for yourself. Where To Start Investing Your Money Via Dollar Cost Averaging? One way you can start employing the DCA strategy is by investing in a Regular Shares Savings (RSS) plan. An RSS plan allows you to make small monthly contributions into eligible stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) or other global markets. You can also seek to invest with a platform provider, commonly termed robo-advisors. These digital financial advisers help you allocate your funds to broadly diversified investments in Singapore as well as in global markets. Another option is to make your money work for you by ploughing it into a savings plan, such as AIA Smart Wealth Builder. You can tailor your premium payment amount as well as how long you intend to continue paying the premium – single premium, 5 years, 10 years, 15 years or 20 years. While you are applying a form of DCA into the policy in the long-term, you also enjoy 100% capital guarantee from the 15th year no matter how the market performs. The policy also gives you the flexibility to withdraw money along the way, especially when key milestones occur such as paying for your child’s tertiary education as well as when you hit retirement. Going one step further, you can also utilise this policy to leave behind a legacy for your loved ones, letting them continue to compound its returns even after you pass on. Take Care Of Your Health As You Take Care Of Your Wealth Accumulating a nest egg is an important consideration. However, you should not neglect your health in the pursuit of money. Similar to putting away small sums of money each month to strengthen your nest egg in the long term. Having healthy habits and making positive lifestyle changes over the long-term will ensure you remain in the pink of health in years to come. AIA Vitality, our comprehensive wellness programme, encourages you to make healthier decisions by taking a personalised approach to help you focus on your individual health journey. To help you understand yourself better, there are various health assessments you can take to gauge your fitness, nutrition, sleep, mental well-being and Vitality age. To keep you on track, there are numerous rewards, including discounts for insurance premiums, entertainment and travel activities, gym membership, fitness devices, and health and nutritional screenings. When you think about it, your health is your true wealth – with it, you can choose to continue working to build your nest egg to achieve a more comfortable retirement. 4 STOCKS THIS WEEK Singtel (Z74); StarHub (CC3); NetLink (CJLU): Local Telcos Dividend Yield And Share Price Performance BRANDED CONTENT Cashback Vs Miles: How To Enjoy The Best Of Both Worlds MONEY Complete Guide To Multi-Currency Accounts And Wallets In Singapore [YouTrip, Revolut, Wise, DBS My Account, UOB Mighty FX And More] INSIGHTS 7 International Rankings That Singaporeans Enjoy PROPERTY En Bloc Deal: 3 Ways You Can Still Not Make Any Money COLUMNS 8 Things You Need To Know Before Heading To The Money Changer BRANDED CONTENT Why Homeowners Should Avoid Overspending on Their HDB Flats MONEY 11 Joints Savings Account To Open With Your Spouse Or Parents BONDS AND FIXED INCOME Step By Step Guide To Buying T-Bills Online Using Your CPF OA Savings ESTATE GUIDE Neighbourhood Estate Guide: Rediscovering Jurong East, The Regional Centre Of The West                     Copyright © 2019 DollarsAndSense. \n",

The stock market has always been of great interest to me. Even as a child, I was helping my mom to look at stock prices on the teletext daily. After turning 21, I opened a brokerage account and started buying stocks. As a student then, I didn’t have that much money. This means I could only buy 1 or 2 different stocks since we needed to buy them in lots of 1,000 shares back then. For example, a stock like Singtel trading at $3.00 per share then would cost at least $3,000 per transaction. If we wanted to invest in bank stocks like OCBC, we would need at least $8,000 to $9,000 to buy 1,000 shares for each transaction. Back then, there weren’t any robo-advisory platforms we could use. This could be one reason why many older investors (above 40) tend to hold individual stocks in their portfolio today, and need to diversify their investments appropriately. Younger investors (30 and below) tend to hold a larger proportion of their investments in robo-advisory portfolios and may choose 1 or 2 platforms they are familiar with to invest through. But is it an investment bias that each generation has? Do older investors know more about stocks, making it easier for them to invest in stocks while younger investors who are less familiar with stocks would choose to park their money with robo-advisors instead? In my opinion, it’s investing habits that actually keep people investing in the same way that they are used to. If you lack investment experience and find it hard to start investing, it’s important that you start building your investment knowledge first. At the same time, you should also work on developing good investment habits as well Here are 3 simple tricks that you can use to develop investing habits for yourself. #1 Start A Separate Account For Your Investment Monies One of the simplest tricks to develop an investment habit is to have a designated account for your investment monies. By separating your investment monies from savings that you need for day-to-day transactions, it prevents you from accidentally spending money that you have set aside for investing. It also inculcates a habit of always setting aside an amount for investments, whether you invest during that month or not. For example, if your take-home salary is $3,000 and you want to set aside 20% of your salary ($600) for investing, transfer it immediately to your investment savings account once you receive your salary each month. If you are afraid that you may forget, consider setting a recurring transfer each month to your designated investment account. Alternatively, you can get your company to GIRO your salary to your designated investment account and to transfer the money set aside for spending out of your investment account each month. Even if you don’t invest the money immediately, the fact that it’s sitting in your designated investment account will serve as a reminder that you need to invest the money. The OCBC 360 is one such account that you can utilise for investment purposes. The account also provides decent interest rates, which allows you to earn bonus interest for performing transactions like crediting your salary, or buying an investment or insurance product. You can also choose to credit your dividend and coupon payments directly into this “designated” investment account.  Source: OCBC #2 Explore Convenient Investment Options Offered By The Bank One of the advantages of designating a savings account for your investment with a bank like OCBC is that you can easily start investing through platforms offered by the bank. You don’t have to complete separate forms, open a separate brokerage account with another broker or transfer funds over before you can invest. This makes it easy for you to start and keep investing with minimal disruption. For example, one way that I developed a habit for investing was through the OCBC Blue Chip Investment Plan (BCIP). The BCIP allows investors to invest in blue-chip stocks or selected ETFs on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) from as little as S$100 a month. This was perfect for someone like me who did not have any investing experience and could only afford to invest a few hundred dollars each month. Also, as a new investor, it’s better (in my opinion) to adopt a dollar-cost averaging approach to investing, where you invest a small sum each month, rather than make a large one-off lump sum investment. If you are already an OCBC savings or current account holder, you can start investing via mobile through the OCBC Mobile Banking app (download from Google Play or the App Store). This way, it becomes easier to make investing a regular habit – just like replying to texts or surfing the internet on your way to work.  Screenshot from OCBC Bank app Besides the BCIP, there are other investment products would-be investors may consider, such as Unit Trusts or OCBC RoboInvest – a digital advisor that uses an intelligent algorithm to help you invest from as low as US$100, with a wide selection of portfolios to choose from based on your risk appetite, needs and preferences. You don’t need much to get started. You can invest in unit trusts and RoboInvest from as little as $100 (US$100 for RoboInvest) through the mobile app.  For example, if you want to invest in local stocks or ETFs through the BCIP, you can choose 1) what to invest in and 2) how much you wish to invest each month through the app on your mobile phone. Funds will automatically be deducted from your OCBC savings or current account each month to make the investments. You can change your investments or stop investing at any point in time.  #3 Track The Progression Of Your Goals Closely Most of the investments we make are for the long-term. We may be investing towards our retirement, child’s education or other goals such as a home upgrade of a new car. As such, it’s important to constantly keep track of our progress. Tracking our progress doesn’t just allow us to make early adjustments if we are going off-track but also serves as valuable motivation, validation and encouragement if we are doing well – just like the mile markers you see while running a marathon. Managing your money is easy with the Money Insights feature on the OCBC Mobile Banking App, which gives you a view of your spending and also helps you set budgets. Separately, you can utilise the OCBC Life Goals planner, a tool that allows you to set your goals and to work towards it. OCBC Life Goals help identify financial gaps that you may not have noticed while planning for your retirement or children’s education. It also offers you solutions to help close these gaps.  Tracking your goals and monitoring your progress is important because it gives us an indication of how well we are doing, and what else we can work on to improve our results. If we want to get fit and to live a healthy life, we need to develop the habit of eating healthily and to find the time to exercise regularly. Similarly, we need to develop the right investing habits in our younger days to make investing part and parcel of our daily lives. By setting up an account to keep the savings for our investments, downloading the right apps to make investing easily accessible for us each month and to track our goals regularly, we can set ourselves up to be successful in our investment journey. 4 STOCKS THIS WEEK Singtel (Z74); StarHub (CC3); NetLink (CJLU): Local Telcos Dividend Yield And Share Price Performance BRANDED CONTENT Cashback Vs Miles: How To Enjoy The Best Of Both Worlds MONEY Complete Guide To Multi-Currency Accounts And Wallets In Singapore [YouTrip, Revolut, Wise, DBS My Account, UOB Mighty FX And More] INSIGHTS 7 International Rankings That Singaporeans Enjoy PROPERTY En Bloc Deal: 3 Ways You Can Still Not Make Any Money COLUMNS 8 Things You Need To Know Before Heading To The Money Changer BRANDED CONTENT Why Homeowners Should Avoid Overspending on Their HDB Flats MONEY 11 Joints Savings Account To Open With Your Spouse Or Parents BONDS AND FIXED INCOME Step By Step Guide To Buying T-Bills Online Using Your CPF OA Savings ESTATE GUIDE Neighbourhood Estate Guide: Rediscovering Jurong East, The Regional Centre Of The West                     Copyright © 2019 DollarsAndSense. \n",

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING Asset Allocation And Portfolio Rebalancing: How Often Should You Review Your Investment Portfolio? Portfolio rebalancing a standard operating procedure for institutional funds. Here’s why it should be for retail investors too. by Index funds typically rebalance their underlying investments on periodic basis – usually bi-annually or annually – to ensure their portfolio is in line with their investment parameters and risk policy, making adjustments as necessary. Because market conditions change over time, review and rebalancing is necessary to ensure a portfolio’s underlying mix of investments are still optimal and risk is not concentrated in a particular area. For example, your desired asset allocation is 70% stocks and 30% bonds. In a bull market run, your stocks may soar and perhaps grow to 80% of your portfolio. If you wish to maintain your original allocation of 70% stocks, you may need to sell some of your stocks to bring it back to 70%. As retail investors, how often we should review and rebalance our portfolios depend on our appetite for risk, our portfolio performance, and the market conditions. This enables us to manage our risk and returns. Read Also: Why Asset Allocation Is The No.1 Thing Investors Don’t Think About…But Should How Often Should You Rebalance Your Portfolio? As a long-term investor, you could take a page from the funds and also perform an annual or bi-annual review, which will prevent you from overdoing it and incurring unnecessarily high costs in terms of time and transaction fees. In addition to this rule of thumb, you need to also consider the type of investor you are and where you have placed your investments. The more hands-on you are as an investor, the more often you should consider doing a portfolio review and rebalance as needed.

Asset allocation and portfolio rebalancing should be conducted more regularly as you are exposed to more risk on your own. Depending your risk exposure and available funds for further investments, you can rebalance your portfolio in the following ways. Sell the overexposed assets and buy the underexposed assets. For example, if your stocks have outperformed and you are now 10% above your desired allocation, you should sell enough of these stocks such that they fall within your desired allocation and lock in your gains. Invest new money into underperforming asset allocations. If you have extra capital to deploy, instead of selling part of your existing portfolio to rebalance, you can also buy additional assets to achieve the purpose. For example, your stocks have outperformed and is 80% instead of your desired allocation of 70% stocks and 30% bonds, instead of selling your stocks, you can invest new money into bonds to bring up the bond allocation to 30%. Diversify the winners by selling a portion of the big winner and reinvesting into multiple potential winners. This is to reduce company-specific risk. For example, if your Apple stocks have outperformed and now make up 50% of all your stocks, you can sell a portion to diversify into other assets and reduce your exposure to a single company.

However, it might be useful to perform a review with your trusted professional if there are any big, material changes in your life that require a relook at your risk tolerance and goals, so that your adviser can recommend an appropriate asset allocation that works for you.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING 4 Sectors In 2020 To Focus On As We Prepare For A Post-COVID-19 World With danger comes opportunities – for investors who are willing to look in the right areas. by This article was written in collaboration with dollarDEX. All views expressed in this article are the independent opinion of DollarsAndSense.sg based on our research. DollarsAndSense.sg is not liable for any financial losses that may arise from any transactions and readers are encouraged to do their own due diligence. You can view our full editorial policy here. 2020 has not unfolded the way many of us expected it to. At the start of the year, if someone had told you that most people will be working from home, unable to travel overseas and that bars and attractions would be mandatorily closed for a temporary period, you probably would not have believed it. Unfortunately, that’s exactly what has happened in the first half of the year. Neither could any of us have anticipated the stock market crash around March 2020. From 19 February 2020 to 23 March 2020, the S&P 500, comprising the largest and most liquid stocks in the USA, declined 34%, from 3,386.15 to 2,237.40. The only thing more surprising was the unexpected bounce back, with the S&P 500 recovering to hit 3,235.66, as of 23 July 2020, which was higher than it closed at the end of 2019 (3,230.78). This hits home a timely reminder that predicting short-term stock market movement can be a futile endeavour. That said, it’s important to recognise that the post-COVID-19 world on the horizon will be different from what we have become accustomed to in the pre-COVID-19 world we left behind. Like it or not, COVID-19 will have a long-lasting impact on some companies and even entire industries. At the same time, it will also create many new opportunities. As investors, there are some trends that we can focus on as the global economy shifts towards how life and commerce are going to be after COVID-19. #1 Medical & Healthcare The COVID-19 pandemic has reminded us again about the importance of medical and healthcare companies. As my colleague Dinesh observed in a recent article, healthcare companies in Singapore have performed exceptionally well in 2020, with the iEdge SG All Healthcare Index climbing about 66% since the start of the year (From 2 Jan to 23 Jul 2020). Whether these companies are treating patients, involved in developing a vaccine or supplying personal protection equipment, many of them have been at the center of attention in recent months as the world scramble to manage the COVID-19 outbreak. Many governments around the world also had to dig deep into their pockets to tackle the current problem, and we can expect this to continue in the foreseeable future. Even after the world has overcome COVID-19, medical and healthcare matters are likely to remain a national priority for many countries, and the world will continue to take added precautions to contain any future potential outbreak of viruses. Money that used to go towards travelling may be redirected towards medical and healthcare companies instead. The right companies in the sector can take advantage of this potential for strong growth in the years to come. #2 Technology Even as brick and mortar companies struggled badly in the past few months due to lockdowns around the world, technology companies, have largely been left unaffected or even seen business boom because of the way they operate. For example, the NYSE FANG + Index, which comprises the top 10 technology companies in the world such as Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google, is currently trading at 4,601.48 (as of 23 Jul 2020). This is significantly higher than the 3,024.08 (2 Jan 2020) at the start of the year. In the past, technology companies have usually been viewed as risky investments, since they are seen as stocks in high growth sectors that would be the first to be affected during an economic slowdown. However, as seen in the COVID-19 pandemic, technology companies are the ones that continue operating normally and are seeing some growth during difficult periods. For example, many of us are using Facebook, Google and Netflix in the past few months to stay connected with our family, friends and colleagues and for our entertainment needs. There are many technology companies rapidly building market share during this period and seeing their value and resilience recognised by investors. Zoom, a video conferencing company, has seen their share price climbed 365% from US$68.72 (2 Jan 2020) to US$251.50 (23 Jul 2020), in just six months as people around the world started widely adopting the use of video conferencing and telecommuting tools. In the future, technology companies will likely continue dominating our economy, including disrupting traditional sectors. For example, Tesla has recently overtaken Toyota to become the most valuable car company in the world and we should expect to see more technology companies taking sizeable market share in major sectors across the globe. #3 Consumer Staples Traditionally considered as defensive stocks, companies that produce or distribute consumer staples have benefitted from COVID-19 as people rushed to stock up necessities out of uncertainty. For example, on the back of strong share price increase in 2020, local supermarket chain Sheng Siong is now worth about S$2.43 billion (based on its share price of S$1.62 as of 23 Jul 2020). It’s worth noting that many such companies have remained resilient in 2020 despite the challenges they had to face, such as coping with safe distancing measures. Many have also embraced new ways of doing things, such as delivery services to reach more customers. While consumer staples stocks may not always produce a high return compared to technology companies, many may pay out a higher dividend yield, which would appeal to investors seeking regular income. Even as consumer staples continue to be an essential cog in our economy, we should keep an eye out on how the sector performs in the next couple of years, particularly for the companies that can embrace technology and merge their traditional offerings along with a digital solution. #4 Gold Gold has typically been considered as a safe haven for parking money whenever fear, inflation or volatility heightens in the financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic has supported this theory. At the start of 2020, gold was trading at US$1.527 per oz (2 Jan 2020). At its lowest point this year, it was trading at US$1.474.25 per oz (19 Mar 2020), and price is now at US$1.868.66 per oz (23 Jul 2020). The resilience in gold price is a reminder that this valuable metal can continue to be an important component in our investment portfolio, providing us with much needed protection against volatility and inflation during both good and bad times. Given the current low-interest rate environment due to quantitative easing measures, gold is likely to remain an attractive option as a good store of value.

Nobody can predict the future, and even companies in the right industry can still perform badly when the entire industry grows. For example, in the mobile handset industry, big companies such as Nokia, Sony Ericssion and BlackBerry, which dominated in the 1990s and 2000s were left out in the smartphone industry boom in 2010s. It’s important to know what you are investing in, but to also ensure that you have a diversified portfolio. Never put all your eggs into one basket, regardless of how confident you are of your investments.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING Step-By-Step Guide To Opening A Stock Brokerage Account In Singapore If you want to buy and sell stocks, opening a stock brokerage account is one of the first things you need to do. by This post was first published on 20 April 2018 and has been updated to include the latest information. This article is written as part of a DollarsAndSense.sg collaboration with . For Tomorrow is brought to you by Temasek, in partnership with MoneySmart and DollarsAndSense. All views expressed in the article are the independent opinion of DollarsAndSense.sg. If learning to invest on your own is on your list of to-dos, then opening a stock brokerage account is one of the first things you need to check off. In this article, we explain essential things you need to know and look out for when opening a stock brokerage account in Singapore. Read Also: Step-By-Step Guide To Stock Investing In Singapore The first (and most important thing) to know is that you need to open two separate accounts. #1 A brokerage account with a stock brokerage firm Via the stock brokerage firm of your choice, a brokerage account gives you access to the securities exchange where you can buy and sell stocks, as well as other listed securities. You may open a stock brokerage account with more than one brokerage firm. #2 A Central Depository (CDP) account Operated by the Singapore Exchange (SGX), a CDP account is where stocks and other listed securities you buy on the SGX are automatically deposited and stored for you. Unlike brokerage accounts, individuals can only hold one individual account with CDP. For investors who wish to hold their stocks with their brokerage firms as custodians, you may not require a CDP account. Now that you know the difference between the two accounts that you typically need, let’s find out how you can get started. Watch Also: Step-By-Step Guide To Opening A CDP Account In Singapore Step 1: Find A Suitable Stock Brokerage Firm The most important step is to identify a suitable brokerage firm. There are many stock brokerage firms in Singapore. Primarily, they all perform the same main function – enabling investors to buy and sell stocks on SGX as well as other exchanges around the world. However, there are a few differentiating criteria that you should consider when deciding between brokerage firms. Commission: When you buy and sell stocks, you pay a commission fee for each transaction. Commission fees are usually the first thing most investors look at when considering brokerages, as the fees could eat into their returns. Here’s a look at the commission charged by major brokerage firms in Singapore for trading on SGX. Do note that commissions quoted are only for online trading.  (As A Percentage Of Contract Value)   You can see that by and large, most brokerage firms offer very similar and competitive rates. You can also observe that brokerages that only offer custodian accounts also offer a lower commission charge. In addition to these charges, you also have to foot the following fees when buying and selling on your brokerage. *7% GST applies on fees CDP-Linked Account Or Custodian Account? The majority of brokerage firms that offer CDP accounts also offer custodian accounts, and usually charge more attractive commission rates as well. Unlike a CDP-linked stock brokerage account, where stocks that you buy are credited to your personal CDP account, having a custodian account means that the custodian (i.e. the brokerage firm) will hold the stock that you buy under their name. This also means that if you wish to sell these stocks in the future, you can only do so through the same brokerage firm. On the flipside, commission fees for custodian accounts tend to be significantly lower. Whereas buying via CDP-linked accounts will allow you to buy and sell your stocks with different brokerage firms. However, you should also note that additional fees may be charged. If you are buying overseas stocks, you will also need a custodian account and will incur some custodian fees. Paying For Your Investments You can choose to pay for your investments via these common methods: Some investors may choose to open a brokerage account with a bank that they already have a savings account or another financial relationship with. This is where local banks may have a slight advantage. Overseas Markets Investors who intend to invest in overseas stocks should consider brokerage firms that are able to provide access to the markets they’re interested in. Some common markets offered by many of the brokerage firms listed above include the US, Malaysia, Australia and Hong Kong.

You can apply directly to them. There are two ways you can do so. Apply Online You can apply online through the website of the brokerage firms. Simply follow the instructions on the respective websites. Head Down To A Branch Office Alternatively, you can head down to the branch office in person to open your stock brokerage account. Do take note of any documents that you would need to bring with you. From time-to-time, you may also find some pop-up booths set up by brokerage firms. This tends to be during roadshows or during investment talks. You can open an account at these booths as well. Step 3: Apply For Your CDP Account If this is the first time you are applying to open a stock brokerage account, you will typically also need to open a CDP account concurrently. This is because the brokerage account that you are opening will need to be tagged to a CDP account, unless it’s a custodian account. Ensure that you meet the following eligibility criteria: If this is the first time you are signing up for a brokerage account, and you are unsure or unwilling to handle the additional paperwork, you can head down to the branch office of one of the brokerage firms. The service staff there can help you process all the documents to set up your CDP account and your brokerage account at the same time. This saves you the hassle of having to deliver the application form on your own. You can also choose to open your CDP account online, with your Singpass by signing up using MyInfo (Singaporeans & PRs only) in 3 to 5 minutes. Alternatively, you can fill in an online form that would take you 6-8 minutes. You can also open a CDP account through mail or by going down in person to the CDP Customer Service Centre.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING Investing Through FSM Auto-Sweep Account: 5 Things You Need To Know Before Putting Your Money Into This Cash Management Account With savings accounts giving lower interest rates in 2020, it might be time to look for other alternatives in the market. by This article is written in collaboration with FSMOne.com. Views expressed in the article are the independent opinion of DollarsAndSense.sg. Last year, FSMOne launched a new product – – which is being described by the company as a cash management solution that serves as an alternative parking facility to the FSM Multi-Currency Cash Account. With its ability to earn potentially higher interest rate at no additional effort required on the part of investors, the FSM Auto-Sweep Account would be an attractive proposition for many investors, particularly existing FSMOne users. But before you make a decision on whether or not you should open and choose this cash management account, it’s important for you to first understand how it works and whether it provides an investment solution that you are looking for. #1 Earn Interest On Your Unused Investment Monies A common problem that many investors face is the challenge of earning interest on unused investment monies – money set aside for investment purposes but have yet to be invested. This could be money from your savings account which are set aside for future investments, income received from your existing investments (e.g. dividends, coupon payments) or sales of proceeds that you receive when an investment matures (e.g. you receive your principal capital from a bond which matures). Read Also: Why Asset Allocation Is The No.1 Thing Investors Don’t Think About…But Should Very often, when we have this money, we don’t deploy it immediately for our investments as we would prefer to wait for the right opportunities to invest. However, the problem with holding cash is that it earns you no interest at all. What the FSM Auto-Sweep Account does is that it automatically ‘sweeps’ your unused investment monies into a discretionary portfolio which is managed by FSM. The aim of this portfolio is to ensure that your idle money is able to earn a higher interest than simply leaving it as cash – which provides zero returns, or in a savings account that provides very low interest rates. It’s important to note that you have to be an existing FSMOne Account user before you are able to activate and opt for Auto-Sweep Account enrolment. #2 What Is Being Invested Via The Auto-Sweep Account? This account is technically an investment portfolio, and not a savings account. The interest you earn is made possible by the returns generated by the assets within the portfolio. FSM does not pay you interest out of its balance sheet. Rather, what they do is to help you manage your unused investment monies. A quick glance at the portfolio for the reveals that this is a very low-risk portfolio constructed using short duration bonds (i.e. bonds which are maturing soon and whose values will not be impacted much by interest rates movement), money market funds and a small percentage held in cash (to maintain liquidity for the fund). Source: FSMOne As shown above, in this Auto-Sweep portfolio, the Fund Houses involved are LionGlobal, a member of the OCBC group, and Fullerton, a subsidiary of Temasek Holdings. These funds were carefully selected for their ability to provide yield and stability. FSM will manage the fund on behalf of all investors to ensure that it achieves the fund objective, which is to earn a higher return than the Cash account while maintaining a high level of liquidity and capital preservation. So, while it’s good for you to know what’s in this portfolio, there is no action required on your part. A small management fee of 0.05% per quarter is charged. #3 What Are The Returns That I Will Get? Since its inception in July 2019, the latest net yield of the Auto Sweep account is reported by FSM as 0.974% p.a. (updated as of 22 June 2020). Source: Since the interest returns of the assets which the funds are invested into will vary, the net yield reported may also change on a weekly basis. For example, back in December 2019, when interest rate levels were generally higher, the net yield of the fund was at 1.364%. All interest earned from the underlying funds will automatically be reinvested. #4 You Can Invest The Funds In The Auto-Sweep Account Anytime You Want Similar to the FSM Cash Account, you are able to immediately invest the funds from your Auto-Sweep Account on all types of investment products offered by FSM anytime you want. These include stocks, bonds, ETFs and unit trusts. Just like any other savings or prefunded investment account that you may have, the ability for you to deploy funds from this account to make investments will never be an issue. Apart from being a convenient payment method for investments on FSMOne, the commission rates for stocks and ETFs are also kept low at 0.08% for Singapore, Hong Kong and US Markets. #5 Auto-Sweep Account Can Be Used To Invest In Foreign Currency Investments The Auto-Sweep Account is a Singapore Dollar (SGD) cash management account. This means it only holds cash and make investments which are denominated in SGD. There is no foreign exchange risk involved. You can however still invest directly in foreign currency products such as stocks, mutual funds or ETFs which are non-SGD denominated. A conversion rate will automatically be shown so that you will know how much an investment will cost you (in SGD) after foreign currency conversion.

Savings accounts: There are savings accounts in the market now that rewards customers with relatively high interest rate returns, though this have been reduced in recent months. However, in order to enjoy these high interest rates, customers have to carry out numerous transactions. This includes crediting your salary, paying bills, using the bank’s credit card, investing and more. With the Auto-Sweep Account, investors can earn reasonable returns on their unused monies, without having to jump through hoops. Fixed deposits: Fixed deposits are a low risk investment instrument that provides guaranteed returns. However, fixed deposits lack liquidity as investors have to lock in their capital in order to enjoy the contracted interest rate. The Auto-Sweep Account offers investors interest rates comparable to fixed deposits, while providing liquidity as investors can use the money to invest at any time. Additionally, FSM users only need a minimum of $50 deposited in the Auto-Sweep Account to get started. Do note however that unlike savings accounts which are insured under the SDIC, the Auto-Sweep account isn’t covered as it isn’t a savings account. Read Also: Beginners’ Guide To Fixed Deposits In Singapore The Auto-Sweep Account Allows You To Hold On To The Advantages Of Cash (Without The Disadvantage) As an investor, the main reason to use the is because you want to enjoy the advantages that cash gives you. This means 1) enjoying capital preservation on your unused investment monies if the market doesn’t perform well and 2) having the funds on hand to seize good investment opportunities whenever it surfaces. The Auto-Sweep Account allows you to achieve both of these. At the same time, the opportunity cost of holding on to cash for a prolonged period of time is also a real challenge that investors face. By helping its users to , FSM users can now earn higher interest on idle cash which are not yet invested.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING 4 Lessons We Can Learn From The Stock Markets’ Bull Charge Reaction To The COVID-19 Pandemic Trying to predict stock market movement is like trying to get to guess when the COVID-19 pandemic will end. Everyone has an opinion, but no one really knows for sure. by 2020 is a year of unprecedented volatility with a global pandemic and global recession. From 19 Feb 2020 to 23 Mar 2020, the S&P 500 has dropped 33.9% in just 33 days, and recovered in 11 weeks. This is the swiftest market crash and recovery in history. In comparison, the Global Financial Crisis took almost three years to recover. What can we learn from the stock markets’ reaction to the pandemic? Read Also: Opportunities Beyond COVID-19: Is This The Right Time To Start Investing? #1 Stock Markets’ Recovery Are Not Equal In general, most people use the term ‘stock market’ to refer to the stock markets as a whole. However, it would be a misconception to think that stock markets are homogeneous. Each stock market has its own stock exchange which comprises of different listed companies. The truth is that the recovery is not the same for all stock markets. Our local stock market, the Straits Times Index (STI), has not staged a recovery as robust as the S&P 500. As of 16 June, the STI is still negative 17.9% from the start of the year, while the S&P 500 is only down 5.9% and the NASDAQ is actually positive 10.8%. Similarly, the Asian stock markets show unequal performance, with China and Hong Kong leading the recovery. While the Nikkei and STI have recovered from their lows, their recovery is not as strong as compared to the Hang Seng Index (HSI) and the FTSE China A50. If you have been investing in the overseas stock indices, you would have seen a better recovery from your investments than the STI. Lesson learnt: There is value in diversifying your investment beyond the Singapore Exchange. #2 The Stock Market Is Not Necessarily A Reflection Of The Current Economy To some, it seems unimaginable that the stock markets are continuing their blistering rally as dire economic data continues to be released. The conflicting headlines, such as “Nasdaq hits record high as U.S. recession becomes official”, does not seem to make sense to most non-investors and even some investors. However, keep in mind that the stock market is not the economy. Instead, very often, the stock market is a reflection of the expectation of future earnings. Stock prices rise and fall, depending on the expectation of whether the company’s earnings would be positive or negative. This means the stock market may price in the expectation of a v-shaped recovery where economic activities will resume, and companies will be able to meet their earnings forecasts. The other point to remember is that economic data are lagging indicators. Macroeconomic data, such as unemployment data, are collated and released later, with at least a month’s delay. Instead, economists are beginning to turn to alternative real-time indicators such as Google Map data, booking reservations and e-payment volumes to have a better sensing of consumer and business sentiment. The stock market is also blind to individual economic hardship and socio-political issues that have no impact on earnings. While George Floyd protests are taking place in the USA, the stock market has continued its rally without pause. Likewise, for the millions who have lost their jobs, the stock market rally is of little comfort. Lesson learnt: Stock markets are forward-looking and can be agnostic to current events. #3 Stock Market Performance Is Driven By A Few Stocks The stock market’s performance begins to make sense when you look at the individual stocks that make up the index. The top 10 constituents of the S&P 500 (forming 26% of the index) on 15 June 2020 are Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet (Google), Johnson & Johnson, Berkshire Hathaway (owned by Warren Buffett), Visa and JPMorgan. These are mostly technology companies and some finance related companies who are not as badly affected by the pandemic and in some cases, may even be seeing some growth. As people are confined at home, technology companies like Microsoft, Apple, Facebook and Alphabet are thriving as people turn to digital solutions and communications. Amazon is still able to generate revenue from home deliveries. Visa is riding the rise of e-payments. When you realise that the overall stock index is driven by the massive movement of a few major stocks, the recent stock market rally begins to make more sense. Lesson learnt: Stock market performance can be driven by the outperformance of a few major stocks. #4 The Stock Markets Are Flush With Credit Stimulus From Central Banks The Federal Reserve (Fed)’s stimulus is the major trigger for the market rally after the markets crashed due to coronavirus-induced fears. In fact, the announcement of the Fed stimulus measures on 23 March 2020 marks the turning point of the market movement. In line with the Fed, other central banks have also implemented huge stimulus packages and lowered interest rates. Singapore has also implemented the Resilience, Solidarity and Fortitude Budgets to the tune of $92 billion to support the country economically through the crisis. Central banks typically implement stimulus measures through lowered interest rates, asset buying and other programmes that aim to increase credit liquidity in the monetary system. This makes it easier for companies to take loans to tide them through rough periods. The Fed has an outsized effect on global stock markets compared to other central banks. This is because of the US dollar’s role as the global reserve currency and because the US stock market is the largest stock market in the world. US stocks make up more than half (54.5%) of global stocks, followed by Japan at 7.7%, UK at 5.1% and China at 4% (as of Jan 2020). While the Fed does not participate directly in the stock market, the Fed has enlarged its bond-buying powers by expanding the amount of bonds ($3 trillion in loans and asset purchases) and the type of bonds the Fed buys (from bond ETFs to individual investment grade corporate bonds). This has led to a drastic drop in bond yields. Traditionally, bonds and stocks are inversely related: when stock prices go up, bond prices go down and vice versa. The economic logic behind this is that investors have to choose between the safety, but relatively low return, of bonds, or the risky nature, but relatively high return, of stocks. However, because of Fed intervention, we are seeing a case where both bond and stock prices are high. Due to the Fed buying bonds, bond yields have dropped to historic lows, while bond prices have risen. In search of better yields, investors have piled into stocks, further pushing up stock prices, leading to the stock market rally. This is happening globally as central banks have injected monetary stimulus to soften the economic impact of the pandemic. The impact of stimulus on stock performance is so significant that the market observers have coined the term “Powell Put” to refer to the point below which Fed Chairman Jerome Powell would not let the market fall before stepping in with stimulus. Lesson learnt: Do not underestimate the impact of monetary policies on stock market performance. With these lessons learnt, investors will need to keep vigilant and balance both risk and opportunity. As we enter Phase 2 of Singapore’s reopening, we need to keep in mind that we have not seen the last of COVID-19, both in Singapore and around the world. Thus, it is still unknown how the stock market will play out through the rest of the pandemic.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING Complete Guide To Investing In The Straits Times Index (STI) ETFs In Singapore STI ETF a popular recommendation for Singaporeans as their first investment. Here’s how you can get started. by Investing our money to grow and beat inflation over the long-term is important to building our wealth and safeguarding our retirement. However, starting the investing journey can be filled with uncertainties and can also be daunting. This is why the STI ETF is usually recommended as a good first investment to start learning about investments and building your confidence. In this guide, you will find everything you need to know about investing in the STI ETF. What Is The Straits Times Index (STI)? What Are The 30 Constituent Stocks That Make Up The STI Today? The  STI Reserve List What Is An ETF? What Is The STI ETF? How To Start Investing In The STI ETF? Read Also: Why Your First Stock Investment Should Be The STI ETF What Is The Straits Times Index (STI)? UK-based FTSE Group, Singapore Press Holdings and the Singapore Exchange (SGX) jointly created the FTSE ST Index Series. In the series, the Straits Times Index (STI) serves as the benchmark index for Singapore’s stock market. Comprising the 30 largest and most liquid blue chip companies listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX), the STI accounts for close to 80% of the total value of all listed companies on SGX. The 30 companies on the STI aren’t always the same either. FTSE carries out quarterly reviews of the STI constituents, in March, June, September and December, and may delete or insert companies into the STI, based on its defined rules. The STI is an index, which is calculated from the performance of individual stocks. As such, we cannot “buy the STI”. For those who wish to gain exposure to the performance of the STI, they can buy into an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) that seeks to replicate the performance of the STI. What Are The 30 Constituent Stocks That Make Up The STI Today? At the STI comprises the 30 largest and most liquid stocks in Singapore, it is always a snapshot of Singapore’s market. It contains many household names you’ll be familiar with and even interact with on a daily basis.   * From SGX Stock Screener ** From FTSE Group STI Factsheet Looking through this list, we can easily see why the STI can be a good place to start our investing journey. Many of these companies are household names we see around the island and regularly use. Even companies that may be less familiar, such as Jardine Matheson Holdings, owns businesses that we interact with regularly, and we just need to do some desktop research to learn more. During the latest quarterly review in June, SPH has already been earmarked to be replaced by Mapletree Industrial Trust. While this has been announced, the respective deletion and insertion will only take place on a slightly later date, on June 22 in this case. CapitaLand Commercial Trust is also in the midst of a proposed merger with CaptiLand Mall Trust. Once this is completed, CapitaLand Commercial Trust will also make way for another entrant. The STI Reserve List Once stocks are deleted from the STI, there is a reserve list of five stocks that will be inserted to take its place. Currently, the five stocks on the STI reserve list is: #i Keppel DC REIT #ii Suntec REIT #iii NetLink NBN Trust #iv Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust #v Keppel REIT You can refer to the most updated list of the STI Constituents here. What Is An ETF? An Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is a fund that seeks to passively mimic the performance of the index it is tracking, like the STI. The ETF manager’s job is not to make active investments to grow your investment returns, but to diligently ensure that the ETF continues to represent the index as closely as possible by performing rebalancing and other tasks. Since ETFs do not attempt to do active trading to try to beat the market, fees for ETFs are lower than traditional mutual funds, also known as unit trusts. Because ETFs are traded on the stock market, you can also buy or sell them any time. In trying to replicate the performance of the index, the ETF will typically have a tracking error. This is mainly due to the following reasons: #i Transaction costs to buy and sell constituent stocks when they are deleted or inserted into the index #ii Bid-Ask spread incurred when making the transactions #iii ETF management fees and related costs Read Also: Why It Makes Sense For You To Invest In ETFs What Is A STI ETF?  There are currently two ETFs that track the performance of the STI: #1 SPDR Straits Times Index ETF (SGX: ES3) #2 Nikko AM Singapore STI ETF (SGX: G3B) Read Also: Here’s Why We Think Your First Stock Investment Should Be The STI ETF As their name suggests, the difference is that they are managed by two different companies – SPDR and Nikko AM. In essence, they both seek to do the same thing, and should give similar returns. You can refer to the fund fact sheets for both ETFs from SPDR and Nikko AM for more information. The key difference will lie in how well they track the STI and the fees they charge. Since an ETF’s job is to track the performance of their chosen index closely, any deviation, even “positive” ones should be a sign of concern that the ETF isn’t doing an accurate job. Just like the STI, these ETFs are market-weighted, so value of stocks they hold is in proportion to the capitalisation (total market value) of the company. As years go by and stocks on STI are reviewed, added or removed from the index, these STI ETFs will similarly track the changes by buying and selling the respective stocks. Also Read: Should A Beginner Invest in Mutual Funds or Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)? How To Start Investing In The STI ETF? There are 3 main ways for Singaporeans to invest in a STI ETF: Method 1: Invest In A STI ETF Through A Brokerage Since both the SPDR and Nikko AM ETFs are traded on SGX, you can simply invest by buying it through a stock brokerage the same way you would buy an individual stock. For those who have not invested in stocks before, we have written a step-by-step guide to buying your first stock, and also compiled a comprehensive list of the online stock brokerages in Singapore and their fees.

There are four financial institutions that offer RSS plans: FSMOne ETF Regular Savings Plan, OCBC Blue Chip Investment Plan, Phillip Share Builders Plan and POSB Invest-Saver. Benefits of this approach are simplicity (you set up a RSS plan online or at an ATM), recurring nature and the fact that it allows you to practise dollar-cost averaging implicitly. Read Also: Step-By-Step Guide To Investing Using Regular Shares Savings (RSS) Plan Method 3: Invest Using CPF Investment Scheme You can also use your CPF Ordinary Account to invest in a STI ETF. It is one of the four approved ETFs that can be invested under the CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS). To do so, you need to apply a CPFIS scheme account with one of the local banks and link it up with your brokerage account.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING How The SGX Investor Portal Can Be A One-Stop Destination To Support Your Investment Journey If you are looking to invest in stocks listed on the SGX, then the newly launched SGX Investor Portal is a website that you should bookmark. by Since the 2007-2008 Global Financial Crisis, investors have not seen stock markets that have crashed so quickly as what had happened in February and March 2020, when the COVID-19 outbreak became a full-blown global pandemic. During this period, major indexes around the world have fallen significantly. Many counters, including blue-chip companies listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX), Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have also seen their prices dropped in tandem with the market. One silver lining of this decline is that stock prices of many high-quality companies are now cheaper than they were at the start of the year. While the short-term outlook for the economy isn’t exactly rosy due to COVID-19, it’s an excellent opportunity for long-term investors to purchase quality stocks at lower prices, and to wait for the markets to recover. While there are many companies around the world that you can invest in, investing locally is also an option especially if you are looking to invest in companies that you see around you. To help investors in Singapore, the SGX has developed an extensive range of tools. Many of these are easily accessible via the newly launched . In this article, we will explore some of these tools that you can use to support you to become a better investor. Open Your CDP Account Online For those who are new to investing on the SGX, you will need a Central Depository (CDP) Account and a trading account. Operated by the SGX, the CDP provides integrated clearing, settlement and depository facilities for people in the Singapore securities market, for both equities (e.g. stocks) and fixed income instruments (e.g. bonds). Stocks and bonds that you buy on SGX are automatically deposited and stored in your personal CDP account, rather than with the broker you used to complete the transaction. While investors can have several brokerage accounts linked to their CDP account, each person is only allowed to hold one individual CDP account. If you do not have a CDP account, the good news is that you can apply for one online. Singpass users can sign up using Myinfo (Singaporeans & PRs only) in just 3-5 minutes or by filling in an online form that would take about 6-8 minutes. To open a CDP account, you have to meet the following criteria. Manage Your CDP Account Online One common problem for investors is forgetting what and how many stocks they own. It’s normal for investors to accumulate stocks via different brokerage accounts, all of which are deposited into their CDP account. With the , you no longer have to worry about this problem. You can login to your CDP account to keep track of your current holdings. This prevents a situation where you may end up overselling stocks that you do not own, which may lead to a fine. CDP is able to provide transaction confirmations (via CDP notifications) and e-statements through CDP Internet. CDP internet will also store up to 24 months of e-statements and 60 days of CDP notifications. All these information can be accessed via the SGX Investor Portal and the service is free. Do note that past account statements and CDP notifications are only available from the date of your enrolment with CDP Internet account – so you may want to sign up as soon as possible to get access to these information. Check Stock Prices & Get Free Resources Besides viewing your investment holdings in your CDP account, the also offers a stock screener that allows you to view real-time prices of all SGX-listed counters. When you include stocks, bonds, REITs, ETFs, DLCs and others, there are more than 1,000 counters that you can view immediately through this portal. You can also screen the companies based on your investment requirements, before adding them to your favorites to monitor them more closely. Read Also: SGX Academy: Here Are 4 Things Singapore Investors Need To Know When Signing Up For those who wish to learn more about the stock market, the SGX Investor Portal also provides a wealth of investor education resources, offered via the . Experienced investors can also stay up to date with the latest stock market news via Market Updates, which is conveniently located as a tab in the SGX Investor Portal. As the SGX Investor Portal is still new, investors can look forward to more features in the future. This includes features such as Currency Conversion (CCY) service, Securities Borrowing and Lending Application and Corporate Actions. Watch the following video to find out more about the SGX Investor Portal.  At the end of the day, whether you are a new investor looking to get started on your investment journey and opening a CDP account, or an experienced investor who needs to stay up-to-date with the latest news, analysis and stock prices, the is going to be a valuable one-stop destination for you. 4 STOCKS THIS WEEK Singtel (Z74); StarHub (CC3); NetLink (CJLU): Local Telcos Dividend Yield And Share Price Performance BRANDED CONTENT Cashback Vs Miles: How To Enjoy The Best Of Both Worlds MONEY Complete Guide To Multi-Currency Accounts And Wallets In Singapore [YouTrip, Revolut, Wise, DBS My Account, UOB Mighty FX And More] INSIGHTS 7 International Rankings That Singaporeans Enjoy PROPERTY En Bloc Deal: 3 Ways You Can Still Not Make Any Money COLUMNS 8 Things You Need To Know Before Heading To The Money Changer BRANDED CONTENT Why Homeowners Should Avoid Overspending on Their HDB Flats MONEY 11 Joints Savings Account To Open With Your Spouse Or Parents BONDS AND FIXED INCOME Step By Step Guide To Buying T-Bills Online Using Your CPF OA Savings ESTATE GUIDE Neighbourhood Estate Guide: Rediscovering Jurong East, The Regional Centre Of The West                     Copyright © 2019 DollarsAndSense. \n",

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING Singapore Mobile Brokerages: 5 Important Factors For Investors To Consider Before Opening An Account There’s more to a mobile brokerage platform than just being able to access the website through your phone. by This article was written in collaboration with Tiger Brokers Singapore. All views expressed are the independent opinion of DollarsAndSense.sg. You can refer to our Editorial Policy here. If there is one thing we can count on in this world, it’s that changes are an inevitable part of our lives. This applies to almost everything we do, from the way we travel (from horse carriage to cars), communicate (from letters to email), and thanks to COVID-19, maybe even how we will work in the future. When we look at stock exchanges, it’s not difficult to see some of the changes that have taken place over the past few decades. Not too long ago, we used to have to pick up the phone to call our stockbrokers to put in a buy or sell order. Our stockbrokers would then execute the order on our behalf, via a trading pit on the floor, either through hand signals or even by shouting. These days, trading pits exist only as a memento to the past. Since the early 2000s, the personal computer (PC) adoption has allowed most retail investors to start buying and selling stocks through the internet on their own. This is not only faster but also less expensive compared to buying and selling through the telephone. And while trading using a PC/laptop is something most of us are familiar with today, it’s not hard to imagine a world in the (not so distant) future where most people will start using their mobile phones to trade, if they haven’t already started doing so. With Singapore’s mobile penetration rate at 159.1% in 2019 (this means we have more mobile phones than people in our country), the question is when this would happen, rather than if. However, using your mobile phone to trade isn’t as simple as ditching our desktop for an app on our mobile phone. Here are some factors we need to consider first before opening a mobile brokerage account. #1 Does Your Broker Have A Dedicated Mobile Brokerage Solution? Anyone with an online brokerage platform can easily claim to have a ‘mobile solution’. But if that mobile solution refers to using your internet browser to access the broker’s website and to use the same interface that was designed for desktop trading, then perhaps what you are using is merely a desktop solution that happens to work on your mobile phone, rather than an actual mobile brokerage solution. Think of it this way. If you are doing mobile banking with DBS, you will likely want to use your DBS PayLah! app, rather than navigating to the DBS internet banking website with your phone. Similarly, if you are looking at a mobile brokerage platform, you want brokerage firms that have specifically designed a trading solution for mobile phones. An example of such a brokerage firm would be Tiger Brokers Singapore, itself a NASDAQ-listed company. Tiger Brokers has a dedicated app, Tiger Trade – which is a one-stop mobile application that allows investors to access global markets and manage their investment portfolio using just their mobile phones.  #2 Comprehensive Suite of Resources You Can Access In the old days, stockbrokers weren’t just valued by their clients because of their ability to execute orders quickly and accurately. Many stockbrokers were also a resource for their clients, given their ability to convey critical information in a timely manner, such as earning announcements and corporate actions. Likewise, besides helping you to execute your trades conveniently and seamlessly, you want to have a mobile brokerage solution that can provide you with relevant information to make better investment decisions. The Tiger Trade app has a useful news tab that brings you relevant and timely industry news about the markets. Even if you are not intending to buy or sell stocks, you can still make use of the app to follow important stock market developments.  Besides the news, there is also a “Calendar” tab that informs you of upcoming major stock market events, such as major announcements, IPOs and the release of important economic data. All these are easily accessible at your fingertips via the Tiger Trade app. #3 Availability Of 24/7 Support If you are trading over the phone with your broker, you want to be able to get support as and when you need it. If you have a problem, you have the assurance that you can always speak to your broker to resolve it as soon as possible. Similarly, if you are trading using your mobile phone, you want to get a similar level of support on issues you are facing, as quickly as possible. And similar to other apps that you are already using frequently (e.g. such as Grab), if you are using an app, you don’t want to have to call someone on the phone to resolve your issues if you can do it within the app. The Tiger Trade app works in a similar way. Feedback, help centre and an online chat are all easily accessible via the app. You can send a message, and someone will reply to you promptly.  An added advantage is that this is a 24/7 support centre, so you are not restricted to only getting support during working hours or on weekdays. #4 Competitive Pricing One of the most significant advantages of fintech solutions is the ability to make what used to be expensive, affordable for the masses today. So, while mobile brokerage firms give you the same services as traditional brokers, they do so at a fraction of what it used to cost. In the past, calling your broker to make a trade over the phone can easily cost $50 or more for a one-way transaction. Online brokerages have made that slightly more affordable, with brokerage firms in Singapore today offering competitive pricing of between $10 to $25 per trade. Still, some investors may still deem it as still too expensive. With mobile brokerages, the pricing is even more competitive. For those trading in overseas markets, commission fees can be as low as USD$0.01per share, minimum USD$1.99 per trade. For Hong Kong stocks, it is 0.06%, with a minimum HKD$15 per trade. For Shanghai/Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect, it is 0.06%, with a minimum RMB15 per trade. In addition, Tiger Brokers will be launching Singapore stocks on their trading platform by June 2020. #5 Ability to Trade On Different Markets Imagine if you find a great app that allows you to follow and trade stocks quickly and conveniently, with competitive pricing, but it doesn’t allow you to trade the markets that you are looking at. A good mobile brokerage app should allow you to connect to the major stock markets around the world, not just the Singapore Exchange. This is important so that your mobile brokerage solution can grow with your needs and fulfil your wish to build a global investment portfolio. Sign Up Easily, Through Your Mobile Phone Of Course! Last but not least, when opening a mobile brokerage account, do ensure that the platform you are using is licensed and regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) for additional peace of mind. As a licensed entity, Tiger Brokers conducts their operations under the requirements prescribed by MAS.  If you are keen to explore how a mobile brokerage app of the future should be like, check out the Tiger Trade app. The app is available on both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, as well as on your MacOS and Windows devices, for those of you who prefer using your desktop to make investment decisions. As a final bonus tip, SingPass users can use MyInfo to open an account with Tiger Brokers for a quicker onboarding process.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING Opportunities Beyond COVID-19: Is This The Right Time To Start Investing? COVID-19 represents a great opportunity to invest in quality stocks at a discount. The million dollar question though is, which stocks? by This article was written in collaboration with Investor-One. All views expressed in this article are the independent opinion of DollarsAndSense.sg. You can refer to our Editorial Policy here. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted most countries, businesses, workers and households. Unsurprisingly, investors have not been spared, with most major stock markets, including the S&P 500 and Straits Times Index (STI), seeing a spike in volatility along with a major decline in price. As investors, we have little certainty on when this global pandemic will end, or whether things will become worse, before it gets better. This leads to another important question; do we continue investing in the stock market during this period? Or should we take a break for the time being, while we wait for the markets to recover? With Fear Comes Opportunity While some investors may prefer to wait on the sidelines, one can also consider to continue investing even during downturns, so that you capture the upswings when the market eventually recover. While major recessions have occurred in the past (1997 Asian Financial Crisis, 2003 SARS, 2008 Global Financial Crisis) leading to stock market crashes, it has always recovered and surpassed previous peaks. Research by Dimensional shows that stocks delivered strong returns over one-year, three-year and five-year periods following steep market declines. These returns generally also outperformed the average return that an investor can gain in a typical year. Source: Dimensional While a downturn may seem like the worst time to invest, evidence based on historical performance shows otherwise – depicting that it will bounce back even stronger than before once the crisis is over. Behind Every Investment Is An Actual Business Whether we continue to invest during good or bad times, investors should always remember that behind every stock investment is an actual business which has its own products, services, employees and customers. Businesses can be impacted by black swan events like COVID-19. Often, the magnitude of its impact on businesses is both unknown and unpredictable. An example would be just how hard-hit tourism-related businesses such as airlines and hotels are facing now. This make investing during a downturn tricky, and it’s also the reason why most stocks would see its price decline. When we invest in a stock, we need to be confident that its business can overcome the downturn. If we can choose the right stocks to invest in, we can potentially earn a good return on our investment. As investors, we want to invest in the strong companies with the staying power to bounce back. Recessions Are A Great Time To Invest In Strong Companies During a recession, even companies that are resilient and likely to survive will see its price decline. This is simply the nature of the stock market. When market sentiments are weak, stock prices will fall across the board. Rather than worry about whether we should invest during this downturn, the more important question is this: Which companies should we invest in? After identifying these strong companies that we want to invest in, going in during a downturn means paying less for the stocks of these quality companies, as compared to investing in them during a bull market. Similarly, while it might seem attractive to invest in companies after their stock price have been battered, we cannot do it blindly as some companies may never recover. Think of it this way; there is never a bad time to invest in strong companies. Likewise, there is never a good time to invest in bad companies. No matter what, we want to choose strong companies with robust business models and balance sheets. A recession shouldn’t change that simply because a company’s stock price becomes irresistible. A Recession May Make It Easier To Spot Good Companies During times of economic growth when most businesses are profitable, it can be difficult to spot good companies. Merely focusing on companies that are making the highest profits may also mean missing out well-run businesses that do not need to take excessive risks. However, during a recession, the focus changes. Instead of looking at profitability, investors start to look for companies that are resilient. These are companies that have strong cash flow, a less cyclical business, and for those with cyclical business, the ability to come out of recession in a stronger position compared to their peers. It’s also a misconception to think that only large-cap or multinational companies can weather recessions. Both large-cap companies and small-cap companies can have businesses that are resilient. At the same time, no company, big or small, is entirely immune to the impact of a recession. In fact, the bigger they are, the harder they may sometimes fall. An unfortunate example of a big local company that has been hit hard by this recession is Singapore Airlines (SIA), our country’s national carrier. Since March 2020, SIA share price has tumbled from 5.742 (2 March) to 3.76 (27 May), or a decline of about 41% (note, this already takes into consideration the lower ex-rights price) Source: Similar to other airlines and travel-related companies, SIA business has naturally been impacted heavily due to the curb of global travel. On the other hand, a smaller-cap local company such as Sheng Siong have seen their share price rise significantly over the past months. Since the start of the year, Sheng Siong stock price have climbed from 1.24 (31 Dec 2019) to 1.55 (27 May 2020), an increase of 25%. In March, share price did declined to 1.02 (19 March) in tandem with the market. However, it has since recovered quickly due to higher revenue arising from a greater level of grocery shopping. Source: Our point here isn’t to say that SIA is not a strong company and that you should invest in Sheng Siong instead. We are not making a recommendation. Rather, what we are saying is that investors shouldn’t generalise the strength of a company based purely on just its size. Larger-cap stocks are not always safer as compared to smaller-cap stocks. Instead, we should invest in a company because we are confident of its business, and its ability to sustain itself through both good and bad times.

After a record 11-year bull-run in the stock markets, typically represented by the S&P500 index, it took just 16 days to tumble more than 20% into a bear market – making it the fastest crash in the history of the stock market. What followed has been equally entrancing – the best five day price jumps into a bull market in the last 46 years. While the stock markets are so volatile, the drastic impacts of COVID-19 on global financial markets has definitely captured the imaginations of both new and experienced investors. Best Time To Invest? While many existing investors are likely to be sitting on paper losses in the near-term, the sharp decline in asset prices also creates interesting opportunities for investors to accumulate stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and REITs during this period when prices are lower. At the same time, many new investors may also be enticed to enter the market because of the current downturn. For these investors, depressed prices may present a once-in-a-decade opportunity to invest in stocks when prices are low. Another group of investors prefer relying on volatility to profit from the markets. Evidenced from SGX’s latest Q3 results announcement where it announced a surge in trading volume which lifted its profitability to 13-year highs, there may be opportunities to buy at lower prices and sell as prices rebound. Regardless of whether you are a new or experienced investor or a trader, it’s important that you understand your investment objectives before entering an investment position. While prices may be low, it can go much lower. Right now, we are also at the beginning phase of realising how the coronavirus will impact Singapore and the global economy. For traders, volatility may increase opportunities for profit, and also the risks of larger losses. Are You Investing For The Short-Term? Quite possibly, the most important question you should ask yourself is how long you intend to hold on to your investments? If your investment time horizon is about a year or even much less, chances are that you are likely to be seeking to profit from the volatility in the markets rather than the resilience of the business or a recovery in the economy. Looking past a company’s ability to ride out such a big shock to the economy, even good and profitable businesses do not grow so quickly. It spans years and even decades, for companies to realise their potential and see their growth reflected in their stock prices. On the other hand, during periods of heightened volatility, the resilience and ability of strong companies to navigate downturns in the long-term may not completely shield even strong companies from facing dips in the stock prices and experience volatility in the short-term. For example, between 24 February 2020 and 23 March 2020, SingTel share prices dropped 26% from $3.10 to $2.28. Since then, it has recovered to $2.66 as of 15 May 2020, or an increase of about 17%. While we don’t know what the immediate future holds for SingTel, it’s not out of the realm of reality to think that SingTel will survive this downturn. It is also not difficult to see how even if prices were to remain generally stable in the long-term, it’s still possible for investors to make use of volatility to capture short-term profits. Are You Investing For The Long-Term? As a long-term investor, short-term volatility should not affect your long-term investment positions. This is because when you invest for the long-term, short-term price swings only lead to paper losses or gains. In fact, a dip in prices may present the opportunity to accumulate more stocks in the companies that you are already invested in and believe will do well in the long-term. What You Invest In Is Important. How You Invest Is Also Important Depending on your investment objectives, stocks, bonds, indexes, ETFs or REITs can all be invested for long-term returns or short-term to earn a profit. At the same time, how you invest in these assets also matter. If you are investing in a company you believe has strong long-term fundamentals and has the potential to be even more valuable in the future, then you should own its stocks and hold it for a long period of time. In this case, you need to open a stock brokerage account to buy its stock. You may also want to avoid borrowing to invest, since borrowing magnifies your position and comes with a cost. Over the long-term, volatility can wreak havoc on your portfolio if you are magnifying your positions and there is also a risk that the stock does not grow uniformly leading to losses from the cost of borrowing. However, if you are investing in a company because you think there is an overreaction on its stock price decline, and that prices will rebound soon, you may prefer taking a long position using a Contract for Difference (CFD). You may even wish to use leverage to increase your portfolio exposure and hence get a higher return, while also remembering that the use of leverage will increase your risk. This way, you never need to own the underlying asset and can derive a larger profit with a smaller investment amount. Use The Appropriate Instruments For Different Investment Strategies You won’t use a spanner to knock a nail in the wall – use the right tools for the right job matters. Depending on whether you are investing for short-term profits or long-term returns, you should use the right investment instruments. If you wish to invest and hold on to stocks, ETFs and REITs, which are listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) or other major overseas stock exchanges – such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), NASDAQ Stock Market (NASDAQ), Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX), and Bursa Malaysia – you can use a local brokerage firm such as . Read Also: Pros And Cons Of Investing In Local VS Overseas Stocks For those who are looking to capitalise on short-term price swings, it may be worthwhile to consider CFDs instead. A CFD is a contract between two parties to exchange the difference between the price of an asset from its opening position to its closing position. When you buy a CFD, you don’t actually own the underlying asset, nor do you need to. Unlike buying a stock, where you only make profits if prices go up, you can take both long and short positions using a CFD, generating profits when prices go up or down respectively. UOB Kay Hian offers a wide range of CFDs, including CFD Equities (for stock trading), CFD Indices (for indices trading) and CFD 10. CFD 10 is a unique product exclusive to UOB Kay Hian allowing investors to trade CFD Equities using leverage on a short-term basis. It offers interest-free financing and lower margin requirements for the first 10 calendar days, while also providing you with leverage of up to 10 times. So, if you intend to take on a short-term trading position with a small capital outlay, the CFD 10 can be an ideal investment instrument, rather than requiring a bigger outlay to own the stock. For example, if you were to invest $5,000 in SingTel, you can take a long position worth up to 10x your investment or $50,000. After 10 days, if SingTel’s share price rises by 5%, your profit would be $2,500, before brokerage fees and charges. This translates to approximately 50% in returns as compared to 5% in returns when using traditional equities. However, it’s important to remember that if the trade move against you, the opposite will also apply. This means your losses will be greater because of the use of leverage. If you intend to hold onto the CFD 10 position for a slightly longer duration (up to a maximum of 30 calendar days), daily interest charges will start to apply from the 11th calendar day onwards. So, if you are a contra trader who would like to extend your T+2 contra period or a short term trader who would like to make more efficient use of your capital at zero-interest financing, you can take advantage of the CFD 10 product offered by UOB Kay Hian. Regardless of what assets you choose to invest in, you need to always remember to use the right instruments (be it investing in equities or CFDs) based on your investment objectives.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING 5 Key Insights We Learnt From Warren Buffett During Berkshire Hathaway’s Shareholder Meeting 2020 Learning from the best. by As most of you might know, Berkshire Hathaway had their annual shareholders’ meeting this past weekend, with the highlight being Warren Buffett speaking and answering questions for more than 3 hours on topics ranging from his views of the post-COVID-19 market, economic trends, and his current investment strategy. You can watch the full video here, but here’s a summary of key takeaways we learned from Warren Buffett during the session. #1 Ignore Daily Market Noise To Invest With More Clarity Warren Buffett said: “Because they are liquid and quoted minute by minute, [people think] it’s important that you develop an opinion on them minute by minute. That is pretty foolish when you think about it.” Mr Buffett’s advice is that it is foolish to simply let the market’s volatility affect your opinion on certain companies. Just because prices are up one day and down the next does not necessarily change the company’s earnings potential or value at all. The market can be irrational at times but that does not mean we should be irrational as well. Read Also: Why Investing In The Financial Market Right Now Comes With Both Heightened Risks And Opportunities #2 Having A Perspective Of Stocks Beyond The Numbers During the session, Warren Buffett remarked that: “Stocks are parts of businesses and not just little things that move around on charts.” This is something Benjamin Graham taught Warren Buffett back in 1949. One’s investing mindset is very importantas it allows you to look past all the market noise and focus on the company itself as a whole, rather than just a ticker symbol and some numbers moving up and down. Buffett drew up a comparison between investing in farmland and investing in stocks. Every day the stock market prices companies differently, which may or may not be accurate and in line with the company’s current and future earnings. Mr Buffett continued: “If you owned businesses you liked prior to the [COVID-19] virus arriving, [even though] it changes prices but nobody’s forcing you to sell and if you really like the business; and you like the management; and the business hasn’t fundamentally changed, then these stocks still have an enormous advantage.” Read Also: Are Paper Losses “Real” Losses? And What Should Investors Do When Their Investments Fall In Value #3 Invest And Hold Over The Long Term Warren Buffett said: “I’m not saying this is the right time to buy stocks… I don’t know where they’re going to go in the next day, week or month or year. [But I know that] I can buy a cross-section [of the market] and do fine over 20 or 30 years.” Here, Buffett is not going to lie to you or pretend he can predict what’s going to happen to the stock market – a day, a week or even a year from now. But he knows that based on economic fundamentals, he is confident enough to tell you that if you bought a diversified representation of the stock market, over 20 or 30 years, you are going to do fine.

In particular, he aired his views on the aviation industry, saying: “I may be wrong, and I hope I’m wrong, but I think [the airline industry] changed in a very major way… Four [airline] companies are going to borrow perhaps an average of at least $10 to 12 billion, and each has pay that back from earnings over some period of time.” Warren Buffett explained that when the company has a substantial debt it needs to repay with its earnings, it takes away the upside of owning the stock significantly. With the huge impact on the hospitality and tourism sector, Warren Buffett expects passenger miles in the coming years will be much lesser than before. This will have a knock-on effect for businesses in the hospitality and tourism sector. Even after the pandemic is over and businesses start to resume operations, there is going to be an oversupply of planes and not enough passengers to fill them, since airlines made orders and arrangements for new planes at a time when no one expected an event like COVID-19 to happen. So, even though Warren Buffett likes the airlines he invested in, given the current state of the industry, he sold all of Berkshire’s stake in those companies.

Mr Buffett was asked, why is Berkshire Hathaway holding so much cash when the market has already dipped a significant amount? His reply was that this is partly due to their insurance business. With many customers who are insured under Berkshire, he wants to ensure that they can be well taken care of. Warren Buffett explained that Berkshire has many people who have staked their well-being on the promises of Berkshire to take care of them. “I would never take real chances with other people’s money under any circumstances.” He added that Berkshire fully owns several companies and that when you add the value of these to the market capitalisation of equities they currently hold, the US$137 Billion cash position is not as large as it might seem. Warren Buffett also explained that part of the reason why they have such a huge cash position is because they want to be prepared. The US Federal Reserve did a lot to help out and essentially prevented investment-grade companies from being frozen out of the market. Warren Buffett said that Berkshire is prepared on the basis that maybe the Fed won’t be able to help out the next time something similar happens again. Using These Perspectives To Form Your Own Investment Outlook There are plenty of other gems of wisdom that Warren Buffett and his other colleagues bestowed upon the world during the session, so if you have the time, we recommend you watch the entire meeting. By summarising key insights from the “Oracle of Omaha”, we hope that this will help shed light on the current market situation and give you additional perspectives to form your own investment outlook.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING Are Paper Losses “Real” Losses? And What Should Investors Do When Their Investments Fall In Value Some dismiss “paper losses” as just imaginary, and others see it as a real setback. The truth is somewhere in between. by In the world of investing and trading, loss is a concept many people are uncomfortable contemplating, and thus, there is comparatively less discussion and perspectives around how we should view loss – and subsequently recover from it. In fact, to help shed more light on how traders and investors should handle loss, DollarsAndSense launched an entire content series dedicated to interviewing prominent traders and have them share about their first (and sometimes biggest) loss. With market volatility up and economy down during this COVID-19 season, many investors would be seeing investment losses during this period. They would have heard advice telling them not to worry about, since these are just “paper losses” and are therefore not “real losses”. But is that really true? Let’s find out. Read Also: How Singapore Trader Collin Seow Turned A Debt Of Almost $250,000 Into A Lifelong Advantage #myfirstloss What Is An Investment Loss? If you can buy a stock today for less than what you initially paid for it, your investment lost value. By definition, you have an investment loss. Had you had kept it in cash, you could have bought the same stock today, and have some spare change left. That loss is real, whether or not you decide to exit your position. Some people have the mistaken thinking that if they don’t sell their stock, they haven’t really lost money. And they would hold on to a loser in hope (more than in expectation) that the stock will somehow recover in price. Or they would double down on their losing investment, thinking that dollar-cost-averaging would even out their entry price, thus reducing their “paper loss”. But you should remember that buying cheaper later on doesn’t erase the fact that you did indeed lose money on your initial investment. Such thinking is mathematically wrong, and a bad basis for making investment decisions. Do you now see how dangerous the concept of “paper loss” is? Read Also: Young Investors: 5 Reasons Why You Actually Can’t Afford To Lose Money Or Take High Risks What Can Investors Do When Their Investment Made A Loss? It might sound harsh to say, but the best thing to do is to have a plan even before making your investment. That way, you won’t be reacting purely based on emotions, which is a common pitfall that investors, even seasoned ones, continue to grapple against. You should set your overall investment goals, and be able to articulate how buying that particular stock or fund will help you achieve those goals. For example, if your purpose of buying a stock because you want to be a little more diversified, dumping the rest of your war chest into that stock just because its price plunged, doesn’t make a lot of sense. When you decide to make an investment, wargame various scenarios and decide what you would do in those situations. When would you cut your losses? Under what situations will you be willing to dollar-cost-average and buy more of that counter? What happens when something really bad happens to the company? Every time prices move significantly, it is time to re-evaluate both the external market conditions as well as your internal portfolio composition. Is your investment portfolio still equipped to help you achieve your investment objectives, given the new external conditions? Once you do so, you’ll be able to decide if your current loss-making holdings are still valuable and worth keeping around, or if other stocks are now even more attractive and come with less downside that you might want to acquire instead. Remember, you can’t do anything about your losses already incurred, but you certainly can do something today to ensure you have the greatest returns in the future. Read Also: How To Secure A Million-Dollar Retirement In Spite Of COVID-19 Crisis Type Market Crashes A Paper Loss Can Turn Into A Real Gain, Just Like A Paper Gain Can Turn Into A Real Loss Just as we shouldn’t simply hold on to a losing stock with misplaced faith that it will turn for the better, the converse is also true. Stocks that show paper returns today, can have the potential to drop in value some time in the future. Thus, we should also carry out a portfolio review when stocks show outsized returns as well and evaluate whether we should still keep them around, or cash out when the going’s good in order to plough the money into other companies with better growth potential for the future. Over time, the more important metric to look at is the investment horizon that we set for ourselves. Short-term gain or losses doesn’t matter if we’re still on track based on our longer-term investment goals, and we’ll be able to achieve tangible, substantial growth in wealth without being distracted by short-term price fluctuations. Ultimately, the score that matters is the final one when the last whistle is blown.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING 3 Key Financial Ratios Investors Should Look At Before Investing In A Company When screening for which stock to buy, here are simple (but foundational) ratios that investors should always take into consideration. by The COVID-19 outbreak has negatively affected most companies, with many having to tighten their operating cash flows and such. This could cause an issue when the company has some short-term liabilities that they need to pay for. During this COVID-19 outbreak, we should focus on investing in companies with strong cash flow and healthy balance sheets, which can help them tide through this tough time. For this article, we will take a look at 3 key ratios to look out for when investing in stocks during the COVID-19 outbreak. # 1 Current and Quick Ratio Both these ratios are important in determining if the company has enough liquidity to pay off its short-term liabilities. To calculate Current Ratio : Source The current ratio is a liquidity ratio that measures a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations or those due within one year. To calculate Quick Ratio : Source The quick ratio is an indicator of a company’s short-term liquidity position and measures a company’s ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. The difference between the current and quick ratio is that the quick ratio is more conservative. The quick ratio only includes the most liquid assets and excludes assets that are harder to sell off such as inventory. When looking at the current and quick ratio of a company, we want the ratio to both be above 1. This will indicate that the company has enough liquidity to pay off all its short-term liabilities. It is worth noting that for some industries such as airlines, they do not usually have high liquidity ratios, so you will need to take note of that when investing in such industries. # 2 Free Cash Flow The Free Cash Flow of a company acts as a key indicator to the business’s health and its overall profitability. It is how much money your business has left after deducting its Capital Expenditure. Formula to calculate Free Cash Flow: Free Cash Flow = Operating Cash Flow – Capital Expenditures An increasing or at least positive free cash flow shows that the business is healthy, able to generate more profits year on year and don’t need to dip into their reserves when paying for expenses. There is no fixed answer on what is a good FCF number. Generally, a good indicator would be if the company is generating an increasing amount of FCF year on year. # 3 Net Cash Position To check if a company is in net cash position, use the company’s total cash and cash equivalents minus total liabilities. If the resulting number is positive, it means that the company has enough cash and cash equivalents to pay off all its liabilities. This is usually a very strong indicator that the company’s financial health is stable. Do note that for some industries, it is uncommon for companies to have a net cash position. An example would be REITs and real estate stocks since they are leveraged. Final Tips These key factors might not be fully applicable for certain industries. For example, companies with a lot of inventory on hand might have a low quick ratio. Generally, a good rule of thumb is to have the current ratio to be at least above 1. The quick ratio is a more conservative approach to determining a company’s liquidity and may not show the full picture at times.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING 5 Seemingly Good Investing Advice That Suddenly Look Terrible With COVID-19 These “good” pieces of advice can actually ruin your finances. by It’s easy to differentiate between good financial advice and poor financial advice. What can be tricky is weeding out seemingly good financial advice that only works in certain instances – such as the record 11-year bull run we’ve experienced, and that just came to an end. Regardless of whether the investing advice comes from family and friends or a financial adviser, we need to be aware of the risks we are exposed to when employing the strategy. The advice may look genius because of the way the last 11 years have played out, and they may truly have our best interests at heart, but may manifest gaping holes when the economy dips into recession and markets are crashing. Good financial advice should never just be applicable to periods of economic prosperity. If it suddenly isn’t valid when a crisis like COVID-19 strikes, it was never good investing advice to begin with. Here are 5 investing advice that are actually bad, but may have sneaked under the radar as good investing advice in the recent past. #1 Stock Markets Return Close to 6% P.A., So Invest All Your Money In It To Maximise Returns Singapore’s benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) has returned 5.3% per annum (p.a.) since 2002, while the S&P500 in the US has achieved even better returns of 8.9% p.a. since 1993. These dates aren’t’ arbitrary, they are when the respective exchange traded funds (ETFs) were available. Read Also: COVID-19’s Impact On The STI: How Singapore’s Strongest Stocks Are Faring – And Should You Invest Now? While it may be true that stocks markets return close to 6% p.a. or more, this is on an average basis over a long time horizon – it does not happen each and every year. During strong bull runs, stocks can soar double digits. Similarly, during bear markets, stocks can plunge double digits. For example, in the past 1-year period, the STI and S&P500 have returned -19.4% and -7.0% respectively. We need to understand that past returns should not be taken as an indicator of future returns. Nevertheless, investing in the stock markets can still be sound advice, but we should not be investing just to chase the 6% p.a. returns. We should look at our time horizon, if we have a long time horizon, we can invest in the stock markets and potentially achieve the 6% p.a. returns or even higher. If we are nearing retirement, we may want to invest in less risky investments, such as bonds, or even contribute to our CPF Special Account (SA) or Retirement Account (RA). We should also note that the often-quoted figure of 6% p.a. is a benchmark for market returns. This means investing in broad country indexes such as the STI ETF or S&P500 ETF. Investing in individual stocks can introduce greater risks and volatility to our returns. Read Also: How To Secure A Million-Dollar Retirement In Spite Of COVID-19 Crisis Type Market Crashes #2 You Can Afford To Take Greater Investment Risks When You Are Younger Another way to convince us to invest more aggressively is by telling us we have a sufficient time horizon to ride out market booms and bust to achieve a good return – such as 6% p.a. This advice can come in different forms too: No pain, no gain; big risks, big returns. While it is true we can likely achieve better outcomes by taking higher investment risks, especially while we are younger, each of us can have vastly different risk appetite, and it’s perfectly fine to avoid risks if we are not able to sleep at night. Young people can also have diverse financial obligations to their parents or have a family already. We may not have much to plough into markets in the first place and losing a sizeable chunk will set us back significant, both financially and psychologically. Young people definitely need to start early. The amount of risk they take should be left to the individual to decide how much risk they are able to tolerate and whether they are in a financial position to take the higher risks. Read Also: Young Investors: 5 Reasons Why You Actually Can’t Afford To Lose Money Or Take High Risks #3 You Should Use Leverage To Magnify Your Returns During the bull run, there were many supposed “financial gurus” advocating the benefits of using leverage investing or margin financing to magnify our gains in the market. We can easily earn a much higher return in the stock markets while paying a lower interest rate to borrow the funds. It can be easy to become blinded by greed and lose sight of the risk we are taking over a period of 11 years when the stock markets were going in one direction – up. Even when questioned, we may think we are able to stomach the risk. Of course, this is because we may never have experienced wild swings in the market which cause it to crash more than 30% at one point. We may also never have faced the prospect of requiring to cough up large amounts of cash after getting margin called, numerous times. Even for those with a high risk appetite, they may not have a portfolio to speak of if they are forced to sell because they lack the ability to cough up enough cash on short notice when they get margin called. Also, even if they can, they will likely be touching their emergency funds at the worst possible time – when COVID-19 is ruining businesses, displacing employees and injuring health.

In the last 50 years, property prices have been on an unending surge. Even major financial crises in the past were only small blips to the price increases. That is why some of the older generation or even property agents may suggest that we should buy the largest possible home – to benefit from the largest possible price rise. If you think about it, it’s yet another play on leverage as well. This terrible investing advice can also come in several different forms:   The reality is that if we stretch our finances to its limits, any potential problem can leave us in a dire financial situation. If we lose our job or are put on unpaid leave for several months, we may not be able to afford the roof over our heads anymore. Being able to buy something is not the same as being able to afford it.

If we save everything we can today, one big problem that can arise is that we become deeply unsatisfied even with a decent job. Few of us will be able to work in a dream job, where our fulfilment is derived solely from the work we do. Second, for those that are able to achieve FIRE, it really depends on what kind of financial position they are in. If they are relying on an investment property or dividends from their stock investments (which may even be leveraged) to pay them a few thousand dollars each month, for an extremely frugal daily living, then COVID-19 may have easily blown this plan apart. They may even have to find real jobs after several years out of the workplace or earning an allowance dabbling in hobbies. Being able to FIRE is unlikely to be the answer to our unhappiness in life. In fact more meaningful work can be more beneficial. Even if we earn less but loosen the purse strings for a more comfortable life, we may be physically and mentally healthy to work longer.

However, you should not strive to avoid these pieces of advice now. They can still be valid actions to take to improve your finances. The difference is that you need to understand the risks involved and ensure you are not going all-in thinking that the markets will continue going in one direction.

Simply put, these entities are borrowing money today with the promise that they will pay coupons (or interest rates) throughout the lifetime of the bond as well as the principal once the bond matures. Investors purchase them as they are comparatively less volatile and risky, compared to stocks. Unlike stocks, bonds have a maturity period. The maturity of bonds can be as short as one year or as long as over 30 years. Bonds with a shorter maturity period are characterised as less risky as there is a shorter time frame for interest rates to fluctuate or, for the bondholders to fall into financial difficulties. Some investors automatically assume that bonds are safe investments, especially when compared to stocks, properties or private businesses. While this may generally be the case, it does not mean that bonds investments are without risk. In fact, assuming that they are without risk is a major misconception.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING What Past Market Crashes Can Teach Investors About The 2020 Crash That We’re Currently In History has much to teach us about how to ride out the current stock market crash and deepening recession. by This article was contributed to us by Samuel Rhee, Chairman & Chief Investment Officer at . Noted American author Tyron Edwards famously wrote: “Some of the best lessons we ever learn, we learn from our mistakes and failures. The error of the past is the success and wisdom of the future.” In the midst of rapidly changing market conditions and events, it would be beneficial to take a retrospective look at past market crashes in 2008 and 1974, and glean wisdom and insights to help us tide through the current crisis and hopefully come out on top. The 2008 Global Financial Crisis It was the beginning of 2009 in the depths of the market crash and the global financial crisis. We had yet to find a bottom in markets. Morgan Stanley was just inches away from declaring bankruptcy before being bailed out by foreign entities. I recall it to be around February when a legend of Wall Street, the elderly 75-year old Barton Biggs, walked into the Morgan Stanley Investment Management office here in Singapore. The office that he himself set up in the 1980s when the Singapore asset management industry was still in its infancy. It’s where I was working at the time as a portfolio manager. Barton actually started Morgan Stanley’s asset management business in the US back in 1975. He had joined the firm following his successful stint at one of the first ever hedge fund managers globally and had racked up an impressive 133% return in 8 years versus the 19% returned by S&P 500. He was not only Morgan Stanley’s first ever Research Director but he also coined the term and was the first to use the title Global Strategist. He was good at it too. He predicted the bull market in US stocks in the 80s, the bear market in Japan and the bursting of the Dot-com bubble and the EM rally in the 2000s. He was a rare breed. What I appreciated also about him was his writing. His reports were always a good read and he was a great storyteller and I’ve enjoyed reading his books since too. “But the investment process is only half the battle. The other weighty component is struggling with yourself, and immunizing yourself from the psychological effects of the swings of markets, career risk, the pressure of benchmarks, competition, and the loneliness of the long distance runner.” – Barton Biggs Barton was passing through Singapore in his Asian tour to take a pulse of the market. He had retired from Morgan Stanley at the age of 70 but had set up a multi-billion dollar hedge fund remaining active as an investor. He graced us with his presence spending time with his ex-colleagues at Morgan Stanley to discuss the macro environment, and markets and opportunities in Asia in particular. The markets were down almost 50% and everybody had lost their shirt. We worried we wouldn’t have any money to manage when all was said and done. And more importantly we thought we would all soon be out of a job. We were desperate for some guidance and sage advice from Barton. I asked him, “Barton, is this the worst thing you’ve ever seen?” He paused and thought for a moment, then he slowly opened his mouth. His answer was completely unexpected to everybody in the room. He said: “To be honest, I think 1974 was much worse.” We all turned to each other and looked around the room and asked. Wait what? 1974? Source: Bloomberg, Endowus Research Looking Back At The Start Of My Career I began working in the industry in 1994 and I had been in the industry for 15 years at the time of Barton’s visit, and it was the third major financial crisis I had experienced – the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the 2000 dot-com bubble bursting and the Global Financial Crisis. As a student of financial history, I knew 1974 was a major bear market but had never really analysed it and thought it was just a run of the mill bear market. To be fair I was just 2 years old in 1974 so it wasn’t like I had really “lived” through it.  At the time, most people were just comparing 2008 with the worst-case outcome we knew – the 1929 Great Depression. We were young and stupid and so walked away from the meeting unconvinced and saying to ourselves that Barton had “lost it” and had become senile in his old age. He has never experienced something like this in his life either as he was not alive in 1929 which was the more accurate comparison when markets went down 86% from the peak. That he really didn’t know what he was talking about. “As investors, we also always have to be aware of our innate and very human tendency to be fighting the last war. We forget that Mr. Market is an ingenious sadist, and that he delights in torturing us in different ways.… Mr. Market is a manic depressive with huge mood swings, and you should bet against him, not with him, particularly when he is raving.” – Barton Biggs It was several weeks later when the market had fallen further and Barton’s visit was already a distant memory. His words had been dismissed as the wishful thinking of an aging, and out of touch, old investor. It was then that Newsweek published a new cover and as I happened to be walking past a magazine stall in Holland Village it captured my attention. It was in such starkly contrasting yellow and black colours that it jumped out at me and it was impossible to miss. I had to go in and buy the 10 or so copies that were on the shelf. All of it. And I brought it back to the office to distribute to the team. The title was simple and straight to the point: “BUY! Don’t believe the bears”.  I am not sure what I was thinking or what triggered me to do it, but I just knew I had to buy it. I felt compelled to do so, and to this day I have the original copy stored away. It was published on March 16th 2009. Maybe just over a month had passed since his visit to our office and the market had made its final leg down by more than 20% from then. It was only much later, in hindsight, that we realised the market had already hit bottom and would never look back. The market low was reached on March 9th 2009. Barton had correctly called the bottom of the worst global financial crisis of our generation almost to the week. S&P 500 Reaches A Bottom In March 2009 Source: Bloomberg, Endowus Research “At the extreme moments of fear and greed, the power of the daily price momentum and the mood and passions of ‘the crowd’ are tremendously important psychological influences on you. It takes a strong, self confident, emotionally mature person to stand firm against disdain, mockery, and repudiation when the market itself seems to be absolutely confirming that you are both mad and wrong. Also, be obsessive in making sure your facts are right and that you haven’t missed or misunderstood something.” – Barton Biggs Now, I’m sure Barton did not know in any greater degree of certainty how things were going to pan out in the future. Neither could he have envisaged all the things we would experience in the global economy and in global markets since then. However, he knew just a few things and he had enough to go with. The first was that as an optimist, he knew that the world would not come to an end. Secondly, thanks to the meeting we had, we now know that he thought that 2008 was not as bad as 1974. Thirdly, he knew from his experience that when the market is raving mad and moving exponentially higher in a bull market or collapsing in a heap of depression in bear markets, he had the fortitude to be able to say that enough is enough. In other words, he thought the market had priced in a worst case scenario and things would actually be better than the market’s collective expectations. Finally, he knew that long term he would always prefer to be an owner of companies rather than a borrower to them. Equities were in his blood and flowing through his vein. He knew it wasn’t a perfect science and sometimes you have to go with your gut. He made the call and the rest, as they say, is history. Unfortunately, with his passing in 2012, he only got to see a part of the recovery, but we of course now know that since his amazingly-timed call, the market never looked back and continued to power forward rising more than four-fold for beyond the next 10 years. Markets Rose 4 Times Over 10 Years From March 2009 To Peak In February 2020 Source: Bloomberg, Endowus Research “It’s as though you are in business with a partner who has a bi-polar personality. When your partner is deeply distressed, depressed, and in a dark mood and offers to sell his share of the business at a huge discount, you should buy it. When he is ebullient and optimistic and wants to buy your share from you at an exorbitant premium, you should oblige him. As usual, Buffett makes it sound easier than it is because measuring the level of intensity of the mood swings of your bipolar partner is far from an exact science.” – Barton Biggs The 1974 Stock Market Crash When you look at what happened in 1974, you realize how shocking and powerful that impact must have been on a young Barton Biggs. The invasion of Israel that began the Yom Kippur War had resulted in an oil embargo and oil prices shot up to historic levels. The end of Bretton Woods and the depreciation of the USD had shocked currency markets. Inflation as a result went to double digits and interest rates spiked up. The US president Nixon was being impeached, and it was the first time in history that a sitting president had resigned because of this and there was political turmoil. The world was shell-shocked, uncertainty reigned supreme, and markets showed tremendous volatility on its way down. These were huge external shocks and the market cratered and ended up falling almost 50% from the peak. Of course for Barton, despite having seen and experienced all the things he had by his age in 2009, the shock of 1974 was living still fresh in his memory. It is akin to my own experience of 1998 when Asia basically went bankrupt only 4 years after I started in my career. The traumatic experiences of that crisis is still etched deeply in my memory. As are the other two major crises I went through prior to now. In many ways, I see now that the 1997~8 Asian crisis, the 1999~2000 dot-com bubble bursting and the 2008~9 global financial crisis were more normal economic cycles. There were similarities in the classical nature of an asset bubble bursting and a banking crisis leading to an economic crisis. A Liquidity Crisis Begets A Financial And Economic Crisis Source: Endowus Research Putting Today’s 2020 Stock Market Crash In Perspective The reason I dug up this memory of Barton and that fateful meeting in Singapore, was because in trying to look back at history to see how we can compare our current situation, I realise that the current 2020 bear market resembles much more to the 1974 external shocks to the system and markets than the others. The fact that none of the events of 1973-1974 could have been predicted. The fact that we are experiencing a major socio- and geo- political shock to the system and it coincides with a major disruption to the oil market and the currency markets, is also salient. The resemblances are not lost on me. Just like in the other three crises, there is still a chance that the paths may eventually converge anyway. That the stresses in the system leads to a liquidity crunch that leads to an asset deflation led economic crisis. However, there is a major difference between 1974 or the other crises and now. Even in 2008, many banks and financial institutions were allowed to go under and this led to further financial dislocations. However, what has fundamentally changed is the ample experience and readiness of the major central governments and central banks in using the policy tools at hand – both monetary and fiscal – to prevent this from happening. My next article will be to discuss these things in more detail. But for now, we still have hope as the massive policy responses unfold, that if and when things do bottom and the coronavirus is stabilized as it is in China or even Korea, then the recovery will be a meaningful one because of the underlying stimulus that is being laid into the ground upon which that recovery will be built. Of course we have to reach that bottom first and we do not know when that will be. “Quantitatively based solutions and asset allocation equations invariably fail as they are designed to capture what would have worked in the previous cycle whereas the next one remains a riddle wrapped in an enigma.” – Barton Biggs Yes, history only rhymes and is not always the same and is not repeated verbatim. We face unique challenges and we have just witnessed one of the fastest bear markets in history and we struggle with the relentless volatility and sharp falls in markets which also feel unprecedented. The COVID-19 pandemic is still playing out, the full repercussions of the shutdown in demand is still being felt and being measured. However, as long term investors we need to go back to the basics. Where will we be 1 year and 3 years and 5 years from now? If we slept through this whole thing will we still be higher or lower than now? How Markets Perform Before, During & After A Recession (S&P 500) Source: Endowus Research In any recession, there is a period during which the market falls by an average of 30%+ from peak to trough(it could last anything between 3 months and 3 years!). The problem arises in that we do not know whether it comes before, during or even sometimes after the recession. In fact, the average market performance is largely flat in the periods before and during the recession. But after the recession is over, the recovery in markets is initially slow then strong and big. If we had slept through all of the 12 recessions of the past, we would not even experience the emotional rollercoaster and pains of that 30% average fall. We would just know that largely the market went nowhere for a long time then went up a lot. The question is even if we were awake all day and night trying to, can we time the bottom, like Barton did in 2009? The truthful answer, if we are honest with ourselves, is a clear no. As long term individual investors, we have the option of executing on a regular saving plans that prevent us from having to time markets, which we know is futile. If Barton were still alive and was with us today and I asked him the same question. Is this the worst thing you’ve ever seen? I think he may repeat what he told us in 2009. Maybe this is not as bad as 1974. Or maybe he may now say that this is not as bad as it was in 2008. But then again maybe it is. Or maybe it is just too early to tell. But I leave you with the last of Barton’s many wonderful quotes why in March 2009, he could confidently put his name on the line and make such a bold prediction. “The history of the world is one of progress, and as a congenital optimist, I believe in equities. Fundamentally, in the long run you want to be an owner, not a lender.” – Barton Biggs Please be safe and healthy and take the opportunity to spend quality time with your loved ones. Take the time to reassess and map out a future financial plan that you can stick to for the long term and execute on your strategies thoughtfully and well. It truly matters. Please reach out if you need help or want somebody to guide you through it. And keep washing those hands!

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING 5 Disadvantages Of Using Dollar-Cost Averaging Into A Downward Market (That Many Investors Don’t Realise) Dollar-Cost Averaging sounds like a great idea, especially now, but here’s some things to consider when embarking on the strategy. by For those following the stock markets, we have already seen COVID-19 severely impact global stock prices. Since the start of 2020, the S&P 500 in the US is down 28.7%, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index (HSI) has plunged 21.6%, while locally, the Straits Times Index (STI) has dived 25.2%. Utilising Dollar Cost Averaging To Overcome Our Limitations For ordinary investors like us, we are unable to correctly time the market and do not have insights into the best time to invest in any particular stock. However, in many research materials, even the professionals have been found to be unable to do so on a regular basis. Another limitation most of us have is that we don’t have a large sum of money to invest in the first place. We also lack the expertise to take emotions out of investing, and may be prone to make sub-optimal decisions to buy or sell based on greed and fear, especially when navigating a volatile market. One strategy beginner investors can utilise is dollar-cost averaging (DCA). When we dollar-cost average into the markets, we consistently invest a fixed sum of money into the stock market over a period of time. We continue to do so regardless of whether prices are going up or down – buying less stocks when prices are higher and more when prices go down. Mathematically, this smoothens out the price that we pay for the stock, allowing us to pay a price that is closer to its average price over a long-term. Read Also: Why 2020 Could Be The Best Year To Start Your Investment Journey (Slowly) This eliminates the element of  market timing or having expertise in buying particular stocks just before they experience an upswing in prices. Doing this consistently also enables us invest a smaller sum on a regular basis and be more disciplined in our approach rather than rely on emotions to form our investing decisions. While this can sound like a sure-win strategy, there are disadvantages we need to be aware of, especially during a downturn. #1 When You Dollar-Cost Average, You Dollar-Cost Average (No Matter What) When we apply a dollar-cost averaging strategy, we have to be consistent about it for it to work. During periods when the market trends upwards, it is easy to continue investing, seeing that we may be better off each month. During market downturns, we need to continue having the same discipline to invest regularly. Majority of the investments we can dollar-cost average into allows us to stop making our investments whenever we want to stop. While this is a key advantage, compared to investment properties or investment-linked policies, we should not turn it into a disadvantage. As COVID-19 has wrecked havoc on the stock market, it can be easy to say that we will stop investing for now, and resume our dollar-cost averaging strategy when markets go lower or start to improve. However, that is exactly what timing the market means – which is something we were trying to avoid in the first place by embarking on a dollar-cost averaging strategy.

This adage is commonly used in the investing world to suggest that we should not invest in a stock simply because its price is falling. If we keep dollar-cost averaging into a poor investment, akin to catching a falling knife, doing so will very likely leave us in the red. This leads us into the next point – we need to dollar-cost average into investments that are not only good, but that also makes sense for the dollar-cost averaging strategy. #3 You Should Dollar Cost Average Into Investments That Make Sense For The Strategy We may not be able to employ a dollar-cost averaging strategy to all investments. For some investments, it will simply be too costly to make sense, and for other investments, the strategy of being long-term may not be appropriate. When we dollar-cost average, we need to do so in investments that can stand the test of time and be cost-effective. If we are not savvy or confident enough to pick out stocks for this purpose, we can simply choose to dollar-cost average into country indexes, such as the Straits Times Index in Singapore, the S&P500 in the US, the Hang Seng Index (HSI) in Hong Kong and many more. Read Also: S&P500 VS Straits Times Index: Which Is “Better” For Beginner Singapore Investors? We can typically invest in country and other indexes via one of the four local brokerages that allow for Regular Shares Savings (RSS) plans. We can also utilise robo-advisor services such as StashAway, Syfe, or Endowus, that have built their portfolios to cater towards the long-term and regular investing (or dollar-cost averaging). #4 A Substantial Portion Of Your Money May Sit Idle While Your Dollar-Cost Average If we have a large lump sum to invest, but choose to employ a dollar-cost averaging strategy – we will have a large portion of our funds sitting idle. These funds are losing their purchasing power due to the effects of inflation or are being held back from growing in the markets. In general, stock markets tend to trend upwards in the long-term. That’s why we’re investing in the first place. If we had a lump sum to invest, putting that money to work, as early as we are able to can potentially lead to better outcomes. If we are investing into income generating stocks, such as blue chips or REITs with regular dividends, we can be losing out on income while trying to dollar-cost average into our position. While investing lump sum as early as possible can potentially lead to better outcomes, it can be a risky strategy. Even if we do not want to invest the lump sum, and want to apply the dollar-cost averageing strategy, we need to think about how to earn a (lower) return on the rest of our funds. This can be through a high-interest rate savings account, the Singapore Savings Bonds (SSBs), or other types of safe and liquid investments.

Better yet, we could have sold everything in January 2020, we would be in an even better shape. Getting in as early as we can, with as much as we can, in the right investments defitinitely works. Similarly, getting out as early as we can also works. Being able to spot stellar stocks like Apple, Alphabet, Netflix, Amazon, or any of the other stellar stocks that we can mention, the current market crash is just a small hiccup (so far) on the back of the last decade of gains. While this is a disadvantage of the dollar-cost averaging strategy, we need to understand ourselves to decide if we should or should not go ahead with it. This goes back to the start of the article: i) Are we able to correctly time the market on a consistent basis over a very long period of time? ii) Do we have the expertise or access to information that will give us insights into when to buy into certain stocks? iii) Even if we can spot the right time in the market cycle to invest or have insights on when to invest in a stock, are we able to keep our emotions in check when volatility strikes?

      "DollarsAndSense.sg TRADING Shanison Lin, Founder & CEO Of InvestingNote, Shares How Experiencing Failure Can Also Help Us Achieve Success In The Financial Markets #myfirstloss Good experiences may inspire us to continue investing and trading. But very often, we learn the most important lessons from our bad experiences. by This article was written in partnership with IG, the world’s No.1 CFD provider (by revenue excluding FX, published half yearly financial statements, June 2019). All views expressed in the article are the independent opinion of Dollars and Sense and do not in any way reflect the views, opinions, or endorsements of IG Asia Pte Ltd (Co. Reg. No. 20051002K) (“IG”). The benefits of learning together in a group are well-known. We can learn from the experiences and knowledge of others while contributing our own insights, mutually enriching each other’s learning experience. Adults learners who wish to pick up a new skill might choose to do so in a group, even though they might have an option to do so on their own. Even the national education system, which delivers some of the best learning outcomes in the world, encourages group work and learning within the classroom environment from Primary level to University level. The same approach can be applied to our investing and trading journey. The financial markets can be intimidating for many new investors and aspiring traders. We have to deal with different investing and trading strategies, technical jargons and be exposed to the risk of losing our hard-earned savings. But if we are afraid of taking our first step, how will we ever get started? To get you started on your own investing and trading journey, DollarsAndSense is starting #MyFirstLoss, a brand new content series brought to you in collaboration with IG. We will interview prominent investors and traders in Singapore and hear them share about their first loss in the financial markets, how they overcame setbacks and eventually find their edge. This is a continuation from the #myfirsttrade content series that we had last year, where we asked prominent investors and traders in Singapore about when they made their first trade. To kickstart this series, we interview Shanison Lin, CEO and Founder of InvestingNote, Singapore’s largest social network platform for investors, which allows users to share trading and investing ideas with one another. Read Also: The CEO Of InvestingNote (Singapore’s Largest Social Network For Investors) Shares The Best Tips He Has Read On His Platform #MyFirstTrade DollarsAndSense (DNS): Thanks for agreeing to be featured. To start off, can you share the first time you make a loss in your investments? #MyFirstLoss Shanison Lin (SL): After my first startup failure back in university, I joined ShareInvestor in 2010 as a software engineer. After the economic recovery from the 2009 crisis, almost everyone in my office was making money from the financial markets, which got me interested. “Pick a stock you are familiar with and are willing to spend money on to buy their product” is an investing philosophy that I learned from some workshops. So, the first stock I bought was an S-chip, listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX). The company is from Fujian, my hometown. I have seen their stores everywhere and have been wearing their sports shoes and apparels for a long time. I invested more than $3,000 on the stock and planned to keep it long-term to watch my investment grow. One day, bad news broke out: the stock was suspended from trading! The auditor failed to verify the reported cash balances in the bank and found accounting irregularities. The company’s stock remained suspended for 7 years until the CEO offered to buy back the stock at S$1.60 per 1,000 shares. My $3,000 investment became $32 in the end. DollarsAndSense (DNS): Your company, InvestingNote, is the go-to place in Singapore for investors and traders who want to share and learn from one another. Why do you think it’s important for people to have a community for learning and inspiration, as opposed to just trading and investing on their own? SL: Firstly, a lot of people do not want to trade or invest because they mostly hear horror stories about others losing money. At the same time, by connecting with more veteran investors and traders, you will realise that there are also a lot of successful investors and traders out there, many of whom can help you become a better investor and trader. Secondly, successful trading and investing are not easy, especially for new investors. Many newbies will not know how to start and which stock to buy or sell. Discussing ideas with others can give you inspiration, perspectives and confidence to get started. DNS: The financial market can be a very humbling place. When you make a loss, some people might start to doubt themselves and lose confidence. Some investors and traders may even be so afraid that they decide not to invest at all. How should people view losses? SL: Losses are something which are naturally scary for most people, but when it comes to trading or investing, we have to understand that there is no such thing as a 100% win. Even the best investors and traders will make their fair share of losses in the financial markets. What you have to worry about is having the right risk management strategy. For any trades you place, you have to be willing to take on calculated risks. In order to be a successful trader, you don’t just need to overcome your fear of losing but also manage your losses carefully. The key here is not to let the losses grow too big, otherwise it becomes more difficult to recover from it later on. Worse, you might be discouraged from placing the next trade. In practical terms, it means you should define your stop-loss level and control it well. Before entering a position, you need to know what’s the maximum loss you are willing to take. This will make you more comfortable with trading. DNS: On social media, people tend to only share their positive experiences. The same can be said for investing and trading, where people will happily talk about their positive results but are less likely to share poor results. Is this a problem and how does InvestingNote help overcome that? SL: I think we always need to see things from both sides. To trade more efficiently, it may help when we get inspiration from successful traders, and also learn valuable lessons from the mistakes of others. On InvestingNote, we also encourage everyone to share their views and experiences no matter good or bad. “Good” experience helps inspire other traders. “Bad” experience helps them learn some lessons and to help others to avoid the same mistakes. We also allow users to filter out posts or individuals that may not be suitable for them. For example, some traders prefer not to see posts in their feed that focus on fundamental analysis. Users can hide other users’ posts or choose to follow people who they think they can learn from. By doing so, everyone’s feed will be personalised with relevant content based on their preferences and goals. DNS: Do you think you have learned more from your failures compared to your successes? SL: Definitely. Whenever I make a few successful trades, the chances of making a loss in the next trade is very high. The reason is that successes and profits can cause my judgement to be blurred, resulting in me being complacent. This is one of the biggest challenge and a lesson for me to continue to learn from. Thus, after making a few successful trades, I impose a “cooling period” on myself and not make any trades for an entire week. I strive to always have a peaceful mind before entering any position. DNS: How have you overcome some of the setbacks in your investing and trading journey to become a better investor? SL: Constantly reviewing your trades is important. When we see prices move, we might sometimes be scared of missing out on the opportunity to make money and we quickly place new trades. It turns out that trades which are placed under this kind of pressure will usually cause you to lose money. Before trading, write down your trading plan somewhere, even it is just a gut feeling. Review this regularly to help you control your emotions and stick to a consistent trading plan, rather than fluctuating from trade to trade. DNS: Lastly, are there any trading or investing mistakes that you regretted making? SL: Knowing yourself and deciding if being an investor or trader is more suitable for you is important. Value investing philosophy was very popular when I first started investing with a lot of workshops and books out there talking about this. Back then, I wanted to be like Warren Buffet and followed his investing methodology. What I learned after that is that there is no one single method that works for everyone and it really depends on yourself. Do you have the patience to buy and hold investments for a long time or do you have the time to do active trading? So, invest or trade based on what you are comfortable with. Rather than to feel pressured in following what others are doing. Learn From Experiences, Both Good And Bad Given a choice, nobody would want a bad experience. We would all prefer to have a smooth investing and trading journey full of ups and very little downs. However, both our positive and negative experiences in the financial markets are important parts of our journey. The euphoria we get when we make money from the markets also comes with the disappointment when we lose money. InvestingNote helps individual users in their investing and trading journey by giving users the tools to share insights, experience and analysis with one another, so that users can help each other be better traders and investors.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING Retirement Planning In Singapore: How Much Do I Need To Save And Invest To Retire At 55? Assuming an expenditure of $2,357 per month, we will need between $450,000 and $600,000 by Retirement planning in Singapore can be quite daunting. As one of the world’s most expensive countries to live in, it’s important for Singaporeans to start planning for their retirement early. As of 2024, the official retirement age in Singapore is 63. However, CPF LIFE payout only commences from age 65 onwards. This means if you wish to retire earlier, say at age 55, you will need to find other sources of income to cover your living expenses. But how much exactly would you need to save and invest to retire at 55? Read Also: What Is The Difference Between Retirement Age And Re-Employment Age In Singapore? Monthly Expenses Needed Before you can determine whether you have enough to retire at 55, you first need to have a comprehensive understanding of what’s your average monthly expenses. Logic dictates that the less you spend each month, the easier it will be for you to retire. Some people estimate their need for money based on the median income in Singapore. However, this may not be the most accurate method. In our view, calculating how much you typically spend each month is the best way. For this article, what will do is rely on data from Singstats to guide us on how much we need. According to the Report on the Household Expenditure Survey 2017/2018, published in July 2019, resident households whose main income earner is between the ages of 55 and 59 have an average monthly household expenditure of $4,713.  Source: Report on the Household Expenditure Survey 2017/2018 (Page 114) Based on a different report from Singstats published in 2016, a household that is led by someone who is between the ages of 50 and 59 tends to have an average of 2.1 working people. If we divide the average expenditure of $4,713 by two, it means an individual needs to still generate an income of at least $2,357 per month to retire at 55. If both couples want to retire at 55, they will obviously still need access to $4,713 a month to fund their expenditures. However, for the purpose of this article, we will only take into consideration the amount needed for one person to retire. Please note that the expenditure data we have taken is from a survey done in 2017/2018, so the amount may be higher today. Funding Your Retirement For a start, let’s consider CPF. If you set aside the Enhanced Retirement Sum (ERS) of $308,700 (as of 2024) by age 55, you will start receiving a monthly payout of between $2,280 and $2,450 (an average of $2,365). To cover our daily expenses during retirement, utilizing CPF LIFE is probably the most cost-effective way for retirement planning in Singapore.

Using Our Savings Only A CPF LIFE payout of about $2,365 a month is around the same amount as the $2,357 a month we mentioned earlier was needed to retire. However the CPF LIFE payout only commences from age 65 onwards. For an individual to retire at age 55, the person will need an average of $2,357 per month, or about $28,284 per year, over a period of about 10 years. An easy way to calculate this is to assume that an individual funds his/her early retirement solely through savings. In this case, the person would need about $282,840 in total to fund an early retirement from age 55 to 64, before the CPF LIFE payout commences at age 65. Here’s a simple table illustrating the amount needed to receive a payout of $2,357 from age 55 to 85. At age 55, the individual will need about $591,549 in cash and CPF to retire and receive $2,357 monthly. Listen: The DollarsAndSense Podcast Episode #1: What Is Retirement, Anyway? Earning Interest On Our Savings However, we should not simply leave the saved amount in an account with zero interest. Since we only need to draw down this amount monthly, we should leave the unused amount in an account that pays us interest. One obvious account that we can leave our savings untouched is our CPF Ordinary Account (CPF-OA), which pays an annual interest of 2.5%. Of course, this is not the only account that you can use; you can also consider other high-interest savings accounts. With an annual interest of 2.5% per annum, we will need about $248,000, and not $282,840, to get a payout of $2,357 from age 55 to 64. This is because our savings also earn interest each year even as we slowly draw down on the principal. Similarly, we will also need $308,700 in our Retirement Account at age 55 for the Enhanced Retirement Sum Funding Our Retirement Through Investments Only Another way to fund our retire at 55 plan would be through investments. To retire at 55 with while enjoying a passive income of $2,357 per month, or $28,284 per annum, we will need a portfolio of about $565,680, based on a dividend/interest income of about 5% per annum. The good thing about this calculation method is that we can receive lifelong dividend/interest income, without having to draw down on our principal investment. If we were to draw down on our principal investment each year and still continue to earn 5% per annum, we would need a portfolio size of $435,000. This will give us a passive income of $2,357 a month from 55 until age 85. Under this method, we will need a smaller portfolio since we will be drawing down on our principal each year, but this also means that we will be left with nothing at age 85. There are two big assumptions that we are making here which we need to point out. Firstly, we are assuming our portfolio size remains constant throughout the duration. Secondly, we also assume that the dividend/interest income of 5% remains constant throughout the duration. While these assumptions are necessary for ease of calculation in this article, they hardly ever apply in the real world, where markets constantly move up and down and where dividend/interest changes constantly. So, you need a margin of error. How You Fund Your Retirement Matters To sum up, how we intend to fund our retirement is just as important as how much we need and when we hope to retire. If you are relying purely on savings alone without earning ongoing interest on your savings, then you would need a much larger sum of money to retire. Through the Enhanced Retirement Sum, CPF LIFE can give us about $2,365 per month. In practice, this is probably the most cost-effective way for Singaporeans to start retirement planning. However, the payout only starts at age 65 onwards. Singaporeans should have a good mixture of CPF savings and cash investments to retire at 55. This will give them the best of both worlds, as they can earn a higher return from their investments while concurrently getting the good risk-free interest provided by CPF.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING Why The Glidepath Is Vital For Managing Risk In Retirement Portfolios How to land safely for retirement by Investments which have higher risk also have the potential to bring higher long-term growth. While the markets may have corrections and sometimes recessions, an investor who can stay invested can wait for the right time to liquidate their investments to realise a profit. Liquidating an investment during a drawdown may mean realising losses on the investment, resulting in a shrinking portfolio. A retiree relying on periodic withdrawals from their portfolio may find themselves in a bind if they have to liquidate stocks to pay for living expenses during periods where the markets are down. Yet, a young investor who invests only in safe financial instruments may find their portfolio growing too slowly to meet their retirement needs. Investing On A Glidepath The glidepath is a concept where an investor begins with an investment portfolio that is initially allocated towards higher risk, but gradually reallocated over time to reduce risk. This is to capitalise on higher potential gains in the early years, as well as to provide more passive income stability during retirement years. Much like how aeroplanes follow a glide path to achieve a soft touchdown, the glidepath is designed to help investors arrive financially at retirement with a safe landing. Read Also: Complete Guide To CPF Retirement Account Reallocating Your Portfolio Automatically On 20 March 2024, DBS launched the DBS Retirement digiPortfolio in collaboration with J.P. Morgan Asset Management. This portfolio automates asset reallocation along a glidepath which starts with asset allocation more skewed towards equity funds when the user is younger, and gradually reallocates it towards fixed income funds as the user approaches the indicated target retirement age.  Source: DBS Retirement digiPortfolio Factsheet In the example shown above, a user who starts investing into this portfolio at 30 years old will have the portfolio allocation skewed mainly towards equity funds. This allocation is gradually adjusted through the years until the retirement age chosen by the user, where the portfolio is mainly allocated to fixed income funds. Portfolio reallocation is automated depending on the user’s current age and selected retirement age. When investing, users select an amount for initial investment and may optionally select an automatic monthly contribution. Based on these, the user can see how much the account is projected to have by the selected retirement age. Later this year, DBS also plans to add a feature to allow retirees to project how long their portfolio will last based on withdrawal amounts, and also allow them to automate their withdrawals accordingly. The funds invested in DBS Retirement digiPortfolio will be allocated to the following funds: Dividend repayments will be re-invested. Users need to be 18 and above and need a minimum sum of $1,000 to start investing. Users can subsequently top up with as little as $100. Funds invested into this portfolio can be withdrawn anytime without lock-in period or penalties. The only fees incurred is a 0.75% p.a. management fee that is charged annually. Read Also: Guide To Using Robo Advisor Fixed Deposits Comparing DBS Retirement digiPortfolio To Other Investments Fixed deposits, Bonds and T-bills may be able to provide stable interest rates, but they generally yield between 2-4% p.a., which is only sufficient to keep pace with inflation. In addition to this, funds are typically locked in until maturity, which means that the funds cannot be accessed in an emergency. While stocks may be able to give higher returns, it requires research and active monitoring, risk management and proper diversification. If improperly done, an investor could lose large portions of their portfolio as a result. DBS Retirement digiPortfolio is vested in various funds, which are managed by professionals. While these funds are not impervious to risk, they are managed by professionals in a way that responsibly manages its impact. Read Also: Investing With StashAway: How You Can Build Multiple Portfolios Through A Single Robo-Advisor Hassle-Free Portfolio Management Many people already have a bank account with DBS/POSB for savings, and into which their salary is credited. This avoids the hassle of setting up an account with another organisation and making transfers in order to invest. Users also do not have to worry about market research, managing risk, diversifying the portfolio, or when to buy and sell. This is ideal for young people who have just started working – while they may not yet have the experience and knowledge to invest prudently, instruments such as digiPortfolio allow young people to begin building their retirement portfolio from a young age. Requiring just $1,000 to start, everyone can start saving and investing for retirement starting from their first paycheck. Those who do not have the time to manage their own investment portfolio can similarly tap on DBS Retirement digiPortfolio to manage risk in their portfolio. Alternatively, people who choose to manage their own investments can still tap on DBS Retirement digiPortfolio to manage part of their portfolio as a safety net.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING How Much Can You Withdraw From Your CPF Account At Age 55? Topping up your CPF accounts makes a difference to how much you may be able to withdraw. by Turning 55 is a major milestone in Singapore. With retirement on the cusp, CPF does a marvellous job of reminding us by creating a new Retirement Account (RA). When our Retirement Account is opened, money from our Ordinary Account (OA) and Special Account (SA) – up to our Full Retirement Sum (FRS) – will be transferred into it. For many of us, turning 55 will also be the first time we get to withdraw cash from our CPF accounts. The question is, just how much can we withdraw? Everyone Can Withdraw At Least $5,000 From Their CPF Once They Turn 55 Regardless of how much we have accumulated in our CPF accounts, we can withdraw at least $5,000 from our CPF OA and SA accounts when we turn 55. If we have less than $5,000 in our CPF accounts, then we will only be able to withdraw whatever we have saved in our CPF accounts. We are not required to withdraw this money. If we want to leave it in CPF, it will continue compounding at 4.08% per annum in our Retirement Account. We can choose to withdraw a partial amount if we want, or even multiple smaller amounts with no restrictions on the frequency or amounts we want to withdraw. This is the base case for everyone. If we have more CPF savings, we may also be able to withdraw more than $5,000 from our CPF at age 55, depending on whether we are able to save our retirement sum. Read Also: What Happens To Your CPF Monies After Transferring It To Your Retirement Account At Age 55? If We Have Saved More Than The Full Retirement Sum (FRS) The first thing to bear in mind is that our Full Retirement Sum (FRS) is $205,800 if we turn 55 in 2024. There are two main ways that we can save more than the FRS (for example $205,800) in our CPF accounts. Below are two scenarios for Person A and Person B: Person A accumulated $250,000 entirely with mandatory contributions while working. Person B has accumulated only $55,800 through mandatory contributions, and the remaining $150,000 by top-ups via the Retirement Sum Topping Up (RSTU) Scheme. In this scenario, Person A can withdraw anything above the Full Retirement Sum (FRS) – which is $44,200 ($250,000-$205,800). Person B can also withdraw $44,200 (($100,000+$150,000)-$205,800). Person C has no mandatory contributions, but managed to accumulate the entire FRS amount via RSTU top-ups. While top-up monies cannot be withdrawn, theoretically, this person can still withdraw $5,000 unconditionally from their CPF. If We Only Want To Save The Basic Retirement Sum (BRS) If we only want to save the BRS – by pledging our property – in our Retirement Account, we can withdraw more from our CPF accounts. The Basic Retirement Sum is half of the FRS, or $102,900 in 2024. Read Also: Accrued Interest VS Property Charge VS Property Pledge: What Are The Differences? Let’s start with the simplest outcome – Person H who only has $50,000 in their OA  and SA, will only be able to withdraw $5,000 from their CPF account. This means $45,000 goes into their Retirement Account. Person F and Person G only have $110,000 in their CPF accounts. Under normal circumstances, they would only be able to withdraw $5,000 from their CPF accounts (because they don’t have the FRS saved). However, Person F has accumulated $110,000 entirely from their mandatory contributions. If they are able to pledge their property, they will be able to withdraw $7,100 ($110,000-$102,900,000) from their CPF accounts. While Person G has also accumulated $110,000, only $50,000 came from their mandatory contributions and another $60,000 came from their RSTU contributions. Person G will not be able to withdraw anything above $5,000. This is because monies topped up via the RSTU are primarily to enhance a person’s retirement adequacy, and which also possibly earned them tax deductions. On the CPF website, it states that while top-up monies form our retirement sum (which is why we can withdraw any above our FRS), it will not be “taken into account in computing how much RA savings can be withdrawn in cash for property owners” (which is why we cannot withdraw top-up monies by saving the BRS). Person D can withdraw $117,100 ($220,000-$102,900) from their CPF account if they opt to save only the BRS and pledge their property. Person E, who also has $220,000 will not be able to withdraw anything more than the $14,200 ($220,000-$205,800) above the FRS. This is because only $50,000 of mandatory contribution flowed into their Retirement Account, which is less than the $93,000 BRS. The rest of their Retirement Account balances was contributed from their top-up monies. Read Also: Why I Don’t Want My CPF Returned At 55 – But I Want My CPF LIFE Payout At 65 Should We Perform RSTU Or Transfer Monies From OA to SA? Any monies we top up to our CPF via the RSTU build our retirement sum. This way, we can create a bigger retirement nest egg, while having the option to withdraw anything above the FRS once we turn 55. Reaching the FRS early in our lives is crucial to reducing some stress over our retirement adequacy, and helps us compound the amount by earning at least 4.08% interest on our SA monies. The floor rate for the SA remains at 4.0% regardless of interest rate fluctuations. However, as we have seen in the examples above, we cannot use RSTU monies to withdraw more from our Retirement Account by opting to save the BRS. This does not apply to monies transferred to our SA from our OA, as it is still considered mandatory contributions into our CPF accounts. When deciding to make use of the schemes available by CPF, we need to bear these things in mind. However, we also need to acknowledge that we are trying to build a greater retirement nest egg, rather than constantly or only thinking about gaming the system.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING The Retiree’s Expedition: Discovering Life After the 9-to-5 The voyage of life. by Retirement is often heralded as the golden era of tranquillity and leisure. However, the retirement journey is not without its complexities and demands strategic navigation. Drawing parallels to the meticulous preparations of a seasoned sailor, the transition into retirement requires a similar level of foresight and planning.  A Clear Destination The first step is setting a clear destination, much like plotting a course on open waters. This involves defining specific retirement goals, akin to a sailor identifying the ports of call. It’s about understanding the lifestyle one desires post-retirement and ensuring the financial resources are in place to support it.  Budgeting Our Expenses Is Like Managing Resources On A Boat Managing resources is another critical aspect of the journey. Just as a sailor allocates supplies to last the voyage, retirees must manage their finances with prudence. Budgeting becomes a crucial skill, ensuring that one’s nest egg can withstand the unpredictable tides of economic fluctuations and personal circumstances.  How CPF LIFE Can Help CPF LIFE is a national longevity insurance annuity scheme that provides you with monthly payouts no matter how long you live, so you never have to worry.   Coping With Inflation As the years sail by, maintenance is key. Inflation, much like the changing sea conditions, can erode the value of savings, making it imperative to have a financial plan that adapts over time. If you’re worried about things being more expensive in the years ahead, the CPF LIFE Escalating Plan provides a monthly payout that grows by 2% a year for life, allowing CPF members to maintain their lifestyle even as prices of items increase.   Staying Active In A Community However, the voyage of retirement is not just a solitary quest; it’s a shared milestone. Community support, represented by the sailor’s network, is what sustains one through this phase. Whether it’s a friendly game of mahjong or a listening ear, the social fabric of a community can help us navigate through any storms.  Health Is Wealth Just as a vessel needs to be in top condition to navigate the seas, maintaining good physical and mental health is vital for enjoying the fruits of one’s labour during retirement.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING Singaporeans’ Roadmap: Key Personal Financial Schemes And The Decisions You Have To Make At Every Age In Singapore Handy guide to keep up with the personal finance schemes and decisions we have to make in Singapore. by We look at how average Singaporeans navigate key personal financial schemes and decisions in our lives in a uniquely Singaporean way. Along the way, and usually when we hit certain milestones, we can expect financial support levers and, often, even having to make financial decisions. Think of this read as the “Game of Life” from a Singaporean perspective.  When You Are Born Even before you can start walking, your CPF accounts are opened. As a brand-new Singaporean baby, you receive a MediSave grant of $4,000. This isn’t just some arbitrary amount either. It is enough for Singaporean babies to pay for your own MediShield Life premiums until you turn 21. These funds can also be used for Integrated Shield Plan (IP) premiums and approved medical expenses. Of course, this means you come under Singapore’s mandatory basic health insurance – MediShield Life – from birth. All Singaporean children will also receive a First Step Grant of $5,000 in their Child Development Account (CDA). Parents can open a CDA for their children at one of the three local banks in Singapore – POSB, UOB or OCBC. The government will provide additional dollar-for-dollar matching whenever parents top up their children’s CDA, up to $4,000 for the 1st child, $7,000 for the 2nd child, $9,000 for the 3rd and 4th children, and $15,000 for the 5th and subsequent children.

Once children hit the height of 0.9 metres (and below 7 years old), you have to present a child concession card when travelling on public transport. This enables children to travel for free on public transport, except on Premium Bus Services and NightRider services. After this, you have to upgrade your travel concession cards each time you progress to an older milestone (i.e. Student, Adult, Senior Citizen).  Source: TransitLink 6 Years Old Compulsory education kicks in for you. You have to attend a national primary school as a pupil, unless you have been granted an exemption, to attend Designated School or to be home-schooled. From 2019, children with moderate to severe Special Education Needs will also be required to complete Compulsory Education. 13 Years Old For all male Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents, you need to take note of your exit permit and bond requirements if you are leaving Singapore for more than three months after you turn 13. This is a consideration if you are intending to study abroad before you enlist for National Service (NS).  Source: CMPB At 13, you are also legally able to start working (with restrictions) in Singapore. Read Also: Can Children And Teenagers Work Legally In Singapore? Your Post Secondary Education Account (PSEA) will be opened at the end of the year you turn 12 (aka, when you are 13). If you have any remaining balances in your Child Development Account (CDA), it will be transferred to your PSEA. 15 Years Old The minimum age required to apply for a SingPass is 15 years old. Your SingPass allows you to access and transact with over 60 government agencies, including CPF, IRAS, HDB, Immigration and Checkpoints Authority of Singapore (ICA), MINDEF (for those enlisting), MOE, MOH, PUB and many others. You also have to apply for your Identity Card (IC) before your 16th birthday. 16 Years Old When you turn 16, you can start working as an adult, without any special restrictions, in Singapore. 18 Years Old You can open a Central Depository (CDP) account and brokerage account once you turn 18. This enables you to start investing in securities, including stocks and bonds, on the Singapore Exchange (SGX), as well as in the Singapore Savings Bonds (SSBs) and other relevant financial instruments. You can also get a driving license in Singapore once you turn 18. You can also start drinking at 18, so make sure you don’t mix the two! You can also get married, but will require the consent of a parent or legal guardian. If you are a male Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident (PR), enlisting for National Service is mandatory upon turning 18. Read Also: Step-By-Step Guide To Opening A CDP Account In Singapore 19 to 21 Years Old Male Singaporeans and PRs may defer their National Service to pursue full-time studies, up to GCE ‘A’ Level, polytechnic diploma, or their equivalent. 21 Years Old You become an “adult” at 21. This means you start being able to vote in elections to decide how Singapore should be governed. It is also the age when you start receiving government payouts, such as cash from the GST Voucher scheme. This also means you can get married, without requiring parental approval. With this privilege, comes you ability to apply for your first BTO home. Read Also: [BTO Guide] Eligibility Criteria For Buying A HDB In Singapore At 21, you can also start applying for your first credit card. However, you will likely only be able to continue applying for student credit cards as you would not likely have started working and earning a wage. It is also when you turn 21 that you can apply for most other banking services, such as car loans, home loans, personal loans and others. 25 Years Old Many Singaporeans would already be working in their first or even second jobs by the time they turn 25. This means they should have some ideas on how to upgrade themselves or if they want to seek a new career path. Thankfully, as part of the government’s initiative to promote lifelong learning, all Singaporeans receive $500 in SkillsFuture credits to use on training courses of their interest when they turn 25.

CareShield Life is Singapore’s long-term care insurance scheme providing financial aid to those afflicted with severe disability. Read Also: CareShield Life Vs ElderShield: Understanding The Differences Between These Two Policies At age 30, your PSEA or post-secondary education account will also be closed. Any remaining funds in this account will be transferred to your CPF Ordinary Account. You can also apply to be a taxi driver or get a private-hire driver licence only upon hitting 30. Of course, you now also look vastly different to when you first received your Identification Card (IC). This is a good time (and also a compulsory time) to get a new IC. 35 Years Old Turning 35 can be a little less depressing for singles! To cheer you up, you can now finally buy an HDB flat on your own. Read Also: 35 And Single? Here Are HDB Housing Options Available For You When you turn 35, your CPF allocation rates also change. While you still contribute 20% of your salary and your employer still contributes 17% of your salary into your CPF accounts, how they are split into the individual account changes. A lower percentage (about 57% compared to 62%) goes into your CPF Ordinary Account, while more is channelled into your Special and MediSave Accounts to bolster your retirement and medical needs. Source: CPF 40 Years Old For enlisted men and specialists, you have now “MR-ed” (put into MINDEF Reserve list), which means you no longer have to go back for reservist. Officers, you have to continue serving our nation until you turn 50. For your career, you can also enrol into the permanent SGUnited Mid-Career Pathways Programme after you turn 40. This provides an attachment to a host organisation, lasting between four to six months, to help widen your professional networks and gain industry-relevant skills and experience. 45 Years Old As depicted in the graph above, your CPF allocation rates change again, with more emphasis on your retirement, via your Special Account, and medical costs, via your MediSave Account, and less on your housing needs, Ordinary Account. Apart from when you turn 35, this also happens when you are over 45, 50, 55, 60, 65 and 70. 50 Years Old Commissioned officers, you have now reached your statutory age, and will be put into the MR list. 55 Years Old Retirement is on the cusp – your CPF Retirement Account (RA) is opened for you. Once your RA is opened, your combined balances in your Ordinary Account (OA) and Special Account (SA) balances will be transferred in. You are also able to withdraw a minimum of $5,000 from your CPF accounts. At this juncture, we also choose our retirement sum– Full Retirement Sum (FRS): $205,800, Basic Retirement Sum (BRS): $102,900 or Enhanced Retirement Sum (ERS): $308,700 – and will be able to withdraw any excess funds beyond these levels. Read Also: [Beginners’ Guide] Understanding CPF LIFE And Your Monthly Payouts When You Retire In Singapore When you are over 55, your total contribution to your CPF account decreases from 37% to 31% – your employer contributes 15% (2% less) and you contribute 16% (4% less). This 7.5% decrease in wages shows that companies need encouragement to keep ageing workers in their teams.  Source: CPF Senior Singaporeans above 55 can also tap on the Silver Housing Bonus when they downsize (or right-size) to a smaller HDB flat, once their children move out. You can look forward to receiving a cash bonus of up to $20,000 on this scheme. 60 Years Old You are now a senior citizen in Singapore. Two weeks before your 60th birthday, you can apply for your senior citizen concession card, also known as the PAssion Silver card. This allows you to travel on Singapore’s public transport at subsidised fares, as well as “a suite of merchant benefits and privileges”. As depicted in the chart above, our CPF contribution rates go down again, from 31% to 22%, with employers paying another 3.5% less and employees contributing another 5.5% less.   63 Years Old You’ve reached the official retirement age in Singapore. From 1 July 2022, the retirement age goes up from 62 to 63. Fret not, there’s no real need or requirement to retire immediately, and you can continue working (also known as re-employment) until the end of re-employment age (at 68) and even beyond. Read Also: What Is The Difference Between Retirement Age And Re-Employment Age In Singapore? You can also start making withdrawals from your Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) account when you hit the statutory retirement age, which is 63 at the moment. You will enjoy a 50% tax concession for withdrawals from your SRS account. For those who contributed to their SRS in the past, you can still withdraw your SRS monies at the statutory retirement age that applied when you made your first SRS contribution.   65 Years Old You can choose to enter the CPF LIFE scheme and start making monthly withdrawals. Alternatively, you can wait till you turn 70 before joining CPF LIFE. If you choose to enter CPF LIFE, you need to decide between three available plans – the Basic Plan, Standard Plan and Escalating Plan. You also have the option to withdraw a lump sum of up to 20% (which includes the $5,000 that can be withdrawn at 55) of your Retirement Account savings when you reach 65. Depicted in the chart above, your CPF contribution rates go down again. When you turn 65, your CPF contributions decrease from 22% of your salary to 16.5% of your salary. Of this 5% decrease, employers pay 2.5% less, while employees contribute 3% less. At 65, you can also tap on the HDB Lease Buyback scheme, unlocking value in the HDB flat you are living in by selling extra years of your HDB flat lease that you will unlikely need. At 65, you will no longer be covered by the Dependants’ Protection Scheme (DPS), which is an opt-out term insurance scheme automatically extended to eligible CPF members, offering coverage of a maximum sum assured of $70,000. Source: Great Eastern Read Also: Dependants Protection Scheme: Here’s One Insurance Policy You Didn’t Know You Already Have 67 Years Old You stop paying for CareShield Life premiums at 67, but continue to receive lifelong coverage. 68 Years Old From 1 July 2022, the re-employment age ceiling in Singapore rises to 68 (from 67). Hitting this ceiling doesn’t mean you are not allowed to work anymore, it just means employers are not obliged to offer you employment even if you are fit enough to work. 70 Years Old You must start making CPF LIFE withdrawals, if you haven’t already started at any point after turning 65. Your CPF contribution rates also goes down for the final time. By this time, the majority of workers would have retired, and this is reflected in CPF contributions as well – with employers paying just 7.5% and employees contributing just 5%, for a total of 12.5% contributions to your CPF accounts. The bulk of these contributions (84% of it) goes to your MediSave Account, while 8% goes into each of your Ordinary Account and Special Account. Read Also: CPF Monthly Payouts Defaults To Age 70? Here’s What You Need To Know About The Viral CPF Letter Circulating Online 84 Years Old Congratulations! You’ve beat the average life expectancy in Singapore – which currently stands at 83.2 years old, according to the Singapore Department of Statistics. 99 Years Old And Above You will soon be joining an exclusive club – there are about 1,100 centenarians in Singapore. Many of your term insurance plans will lapse between the age of 99 to 101. This means even though you’ve been paying your insurance premiums all along, your family will not get an insurance payout after you pass on. This isn’t as bad as it sounds, you shouldn’t have any dependents or family members relying on your insurance payouts to get by after you pass on. Living past 99 years should not worry you as CPF LIFE will continue giving you a monthly payout regardless of how long you live. Read Also: CPF LIFE VS Retirement Sum Scheme: What’s The Difference? Growing Up, And Growing Old In Singapore While important, financial consideration are only one aspect of our life growing up in Singapore. We need to enjoy the process in each of our life stage, as children receiving education, as economically contributing adults and as seniors. At the same time, approaching the final stretches of our life stage in Singapore should not be seen as the end, but rather as a point in our life that we can look back on our journey and say “yes, I enjoyed growing up in Singapore”.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING 10 Investments You Can Make With Your Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) Account You have to invest your SRS funds to earn a meaningful return. by Started in 2001, the Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) is a voluntary initiative that forms part of Singapore’s multi-pronged strategy to help citizens, permanent residents (PRs) and foreigners start building up their retirement nest egg. As an incentive to contribute to our SRS accounts, we receive dollar-for-dollar tax relief of up to $15,300 for citizens and PRs and up to $35,700 for foreigners. Note that we have a personal income tax relief cap of $80,000 each year – inclusive of the tax relief we get for SRS top-ups. To start contributing to our SRS account, we need to first open an SRS account with either DBS, OCBC or UOB, which are the three SRS operators in Singapore. We are not tied down to these operators after opening our SRS accounts though. We can choose to invest in all available SRS investments with other financial institutions. We can only start making penalty-free withdrawals from our SRS account once we hit the statutory retirement age of 63. The statutory retirement age has been planned to continue increasing to 65 by about 2030, so this will affect us depending on when we open our SRS account. For those who already have an SRS account, we will be able to withdraw from the prevailing statutory retirement age when we first opened our SRS account. This is why it makes sense to open an SRS account now to “lock in” the current statutory retirement age for withdrawals. Subsequently, upon making our first withdrawal, we will have a 10-year window to withdraw our entire SRS funds. We need to understand that the SRS acts like a deferred tax system. We receive a dollar-for-dollar tax relief when we make top-ups, we will be taxed on 50% of our SRS withdrawals in the future. For example, if we withdraw $40,000 from our SRS account during the year, we will only have to pay taxes on $20,000 (50% of our $40,000 withdrawal from SRS). If this is our only income at that point, we would not have to pay any income tax. We also have to note that there will be a 5% penalty as well as 100% taxation on withdrawals for those who take out funds before the statutory retirement age (currently 63 as of 1 July 2022). Read Also: Supplementary Retirement Scheme – 4 Things You Need To Understand Before Opening An SRS Account Importance Of Investing Your SRS Contributions Funds that we contribute to our SRS account earn a nominal bank interest rates. This means that if we want to meaningfully grow our retirement nest egg, we need to invest our SRS funds to earn better returns. This is quite different from contributing to our CPF Special Account (SA), where funds earn a minimum interest rate of 4.0% p.a., and when interest rates rise, can go up (e.g. the CPF SA account is paying 4.04% currently). However, we cannot invest top-up monies in our CPF SA. In reality, more than 20% of all SRS funds, or over $3.4 billion, is still sitting idle in cash as of December 2022. With that in mind, here are 10 investments we can all make with our SRS accounts today to grow our retirement portfolio. Read Also: Why Topping Up Your SRS Without Investing Doesn’t Help Your Retirement Adequacy #1 Stocks We can invest our SRS funds in stocks listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX). Remember, we don’t have to invest via the banks that we open our SRS accounts with, and can continue using our existing brokers in most instances. This is especially handy for investors who are already funnelling a chunk of our savings into locally-listed stocks. This way, we can just continue making investments normally, while being able to save on our taxes in return. Even for those who are not already investing in stocks, we can easily get started by investing in strong blue-chip Singapore companies, including DBS, OCBC, UOB, SingTel and more. Read Also: Singapore Online Stock Brokerage Fees Comparison (2022 Edition) #2 REITs Similar to investing in stocks, we can invest in real estate investment trusts (REITs) that are listed in Singapore. Again, since REITs are bought and sold like stocks, we can continue to use our existing brokerage firms to make such investments. There are about 40 REITs listed on the SGX, and they tend to pay out higher distributions. When investing our SRS funds in REITs, we need to note that any distributions from the REITs will be channelled back into our SRS accounts rather than come to us in liquid cash. On the plus side, we can continue to invest these distributions. Read Also: [2022 Edition] Complete Guide To Start Your REITs Investing Journey In Singapore #3 ETFs Short for Exchange Traded Funds, ETFs typically replicate the composition of a broad index tracking regional or country indexes, stocks in a particular sector, REITs, bonds, commodities and other financial instruments. In Singapore, there are two ETFs tracking the country’s Straits Times Index (STI) – the SPDR STI ETF and the Nikko AM Singapore STI ETF. There are also bond ETFs, the ABF Singapore Bond Fund comprises bonds issued by the Singapore government and Singapore government-linked entities, while the Nikko AM SGD Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF comprises corporate bonds issued by investment-grade issuers. There are many other ETFs also listed on the SGX, with three REIT ETFs, the SPDR Gold Shares and many others. Read Also: Step-By-Step Guide To ETF Investing In Singapore #4 Bonds Several retail bonds are also listed on the SGX, and we can invest our SRS funds in these bonds. These include Temasek’s T2023 S$ bonds and Temasek-linked Astrea IV, V, VI and 7A and 7B private equity bonds, as well as other retail bonds that have been listed on SGX. We can use local brokerages, such as Phillip Securities (POEMS) to invest our SRS top-up funds in both stocks and REITs, as well as other listed securities such as ETFs and retail bonds. Read Also: Step-By-Step Guide To Bond Investing In Singapore #5 Singapore Savings Bonds (SSB) While Singapore Savings Bonds were introduced in late 2015, we could only start investing our SRS funds in them from December 2018. At the same time, MAS also announced that individuals could invest in double the amount of SSBs to $200,000 (from $100,000 previously). This is a great way for extremely risk-averse investors to earn a return on our SRSS contributions as we do not take on much risk when investing in SSBs. Read Also: [2023 Edition] Complete Guide To Buying Singapore Savings Bonds (SSBs) #6 Regular Shares Savings (RSS) A regular shares savings (RSS) plan allows us to start investing in stocks, bonds, ETFs and REITs listed on the SGX from as little as $100 a month. It is an ideal way for investors with limited knowledge and interest in monitoring their portfolios to start their investment journey. In Singapore, there are four brokerages currently offering RSS plans – OCBC Blue Chip Investment Plan; POSB/DBS Invest-Saver; Phillip Share Builders Plan; and FSMOne ETF Regular Savings Plan. Each has its own specifications of which types of shares we can invest in and brokerage charges we have to pay. Read Also: Step-By-Step Guide To Investing Using A Regular Shares Savings Plan #7 Robo-Advisors As more investment tools become available to us, we can also start incorporating them into our portfolio. Majority of robo-advisory firms aim to utilise complex algorithms to offer retail investors access to professional portfolio management services. We can also tap on robo-advisory platforms to park our SRS top-ups into less risky cash management accounts – which enables us to earn better interest than just letting it sit idle. The following robo-advisors allow us to invest our SRS funds with them:  StashAway Founded in 2016, StashAway uses an Economic Regine-based Asset Allocation, its proprietary investment strategy to manage portfolios. It also charges a competitive rate and advocates investing over the long-term.

Remember, this extends to unit trusts outside of the three SRS administrators – which means we are not limited to investing in unit trusts that are sold by them. Platforms such as FSMOne, GROW with Singlife and dollarDEX allow you to invest in diverse unit trusts investments with your SRS funds. These platforms also enable us to choose the regions, sectors and even fund managers we are comfortable investing our funds. #9 Insurance Products/Annuities We can also put our SRS funds towards insurance products and annuities. On this point, we have to note that there are restrictions on Life Insurance products that we can buy. Typically, we can invest in only single-premium products, including recurrent single-premium products. We also aren’t allowed to purchase critical illness, health and long-term care products with our SRS funds. We need to check with our agents and/or insurers if we want to invest with our SRS funds. #10 Fixed Deposits If we are extremely risk-averse and unsure of what to do with our funds, we can invest in fixed deposits rather than let it sit idly in cash. This way, we’re pretty much exposed to the same extremely low level of risk but receiving a significantly improved interest rate return on our SRS funds. As interest rates are the highest its been in nearly 20 years, we may be able to find increasingly more attractive interest rates on Fixed Deposits.

Many people may procrastinate retirement planning today as we don’t see an immediate benefit. The SRS helps resolve some of these issues by giving us a tangible benefit, of paying lower taxes in the following year of assessment immediately. We will also be more in-tuned to investing our SRS funds to grow it for our retirement. The 10 investments listed above are not an exhaustive list, however, they provide a good start to get us on our way to making investments with our SRS funds.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING CPF Top-Ups VS SRS Top-Ups: Which Should You Choose? 7 things to consider when deciding to make top-ups to the two. by To help us build up a bigger retirement nest egg in Singapore, we can contribute or top-up to 2 main retirement plans – CPF and Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS). In addition to mandatory CPF contributions from our salary, we can also make additional cash top-ups to our CPF Special Account (or Retirement Account if we are above 55) via the Retirement Sum Topping Up (RSTU) Scheme. While we can also make MediSave top-ups, they do not directly translate into a larger retirement pot for our senior years. Similarly, we can make Voluntary Contributions (VC) to our CPF accounts, but these may not be solely for our retirement needs. Unlike our CPF account, opening an SRS account is not mandatory. Nevertheless, we get a dollar-for-dollar tax deduction for cash top-ups to both our CPF Special Account and SRS account. Thus, we arrive at the question asked in our title – which should we choose? There’s really no straightforward answer to say one is better as they serve different purposes. When deciding between the two, there are 7 main things we can consider. At the same time, there’s nothing to stop us from choosing both. Read Also: Retirement Sum Topping-Up Scheme (RSTU) VS CPF Voluntary Contributions: What’s The Difference? #1 Your Nationality While all Singaporeans and Permanent Residents (PRs) have a CPF account, foreigners here do not. The good thing is that even foreigners can open an SRS account and start enjoying dollar-for-dollar tax deductions to build their retirement nest egg. Singaporeans and PRs can contribute up to $15,300 a year, while foreigners can contribute up to $35,700 a year, to their SRS accounts. Read Also: 4 Misconceptions To Debunk About The Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) #2 How Much You Can Save On Taxes For those contributing to their CPF Special Account (SA) via the RSTU scheme, we only receive dollar-for-dollar tax deductions on the first $8,000 each year. We can also receive up to another $8,000 for contributing to our loved one’s Special Account via the RSTU. We can always choose to make further top-ups to our Special Account or Retirement Account, up to the Full Retirement Sum (FRS), but will not receive any tax relief beyond the first $8,000. The SRS gives us a dollar-for-dollar tax deduction on top-ups of up to $15,300 (and $35,700 for foreigners) a year. This is also the maximum we can top-up to our SRS account each year as well. Besides thinking about taxes when we are making our top-ups, we also need to consider the tax implications when withdrawing our funds to use in retirement. In our retirement, we will withdraw our CPF top-ups, along with our mandatory contributions, via the CPF LIFE scheme. These monthly payouts are not subject to taxes. However, we have to pay taxes on the withdrawals of our SRS savings after our statutory retirement age (currently 63-years-old, but will rise to 65 by about 2030). We get a 50% tax concession, which means that we only pay taxes on 50% of our SRS withdrawals. For example, if we withdraw $40,000 in the year, we will have to pay taxes on only $20,000 – and we may end up not paying any tax if that’s our only taxable income in the year. Of course, there is a risk that we build other taxable income such as investment property rentals for our retirement and may end up paying taxes as well. Another constraint for the SRS is that we have to make withdrawals within a 10-year period. This means if we have more than $400,000 in our SRS account at the point we start making withdrawals, we may end up paying some income tax.

When we make RSTU top-ups to our CPF Special Account or Retirement Account, our top-ups start earning an interest almost immediately – at 4.04% per annum currently. in other words, we start earning a relatively decent interest rate from the moment we make a CPF top-up. While we can invest our CPF Special Account monies, we cannot invest the portion that comes through topping up. This means, if we want the flexibility of investing in stocks or other investments, we may want to consider topping up our SRS account instead. On the other hand, when we make top-ups to our SRS account, our funds will simply earn a negligible interest rate provided by the bank. This means we must invest our SRS top-up monies in order to earn a better return. We can invest our SRS funds in stocks, mutual funds and unit trusts, fixed-income products such as treasury bills (T-bills) and government securities, Singapore Savings Bonds (SSB) and fixed deposits, and we can also invest via robo-advisory platforms such as Endowus, and StashAway.

Read Also: 10 Investments You Can Make With Your Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) Account #4 Can You Reverse Your Top-Ups? While we can’t really reverse our decision in either case, top-ups to our SRS account allow for slightly greater flexibility to do so. Firstly, there’s no way to change our minds to withdraw funds from our CPF. Even if we are terminally ill, we can only withdraw CPF savings excluding monies put in under the RSTU Scheme. For our SRS account – if we change our mind, we can withdraw our funds by incurring some penalties. If we choose to make withdrawals from our SRS account before our statutory retirement age, we will have to pay taxes on 100% of our withdrawal amount and incur a 5% penalty on the withdrawal amount. If we make such withdrawals due to bankruptcy, we will only have to pay income tax on 100% of our withdrawals, without incurring any penalties. If we make such withdrawals due to terminal illness (or death), withdrawals of up to $400,000 will be tax-free. #5 What Happens If You Pass On With Funds In Your CPF Or SRS Accounts? Funds in our CPF accounts do not make up our estate, hence we need to make a separate CPF nomination in order to leave behind our CPF monies in the most cost-efficient way (that will also remove any doubts within our family). 100% of our CPF funds are not taxable, regardless of how we accumulated them (i.e. through mandatory contributions, cash top-ups or even government grants). On the other hand, our SRS funds form part of our estate when we pass on. This means there’s no need or requirement to make a separate nomination for our SRS funds – as it follows our will. As mentioned above, our beneficiaries can withdraw up to $400,000 of our SRS funds tax-free. This implies that an individual would have withdrawn his or her funds in the most tax-efficient manner – i.e. $40,000 a year for 10 years without having additional taxable income. This way, the individual’s taxable income would have been $20,000 and their income tax bill would be $0. This amount may be prorated if we started our withdrawals before passing on. #6 When You Will Be Able To Withdraw Your Top-Up Money? For CPF top-ups, we will likely only be able to see our top-up monies when we turn 65 via the CPF LIFE scheme. We also have the option of leaving our funds in our Retirement Account (funds from our Special Account will flow into our Retirement Account at 55) until age 70 – when we have to start our CPF LIFE payouts. Via the CPF LIFE scheme, we can also choose whether we want to be on the Standard Plan, Basic Plan or Escalating Plan. The Standard Plan provides a higher level of payout, the Basic Plan provides a lower level of payout but enables us to leave a larger bequest behind when we pass on, and the Escalating Plan provides a payout that increases by about 2% each year. Read Also: Complete Guide To Understanding The “Benefit Illustration” Of CPF LIFE Payouts On the SRS scheme, there is no retirement payout plan for us. We can just start making cash or investment withdrawals from our statutory retirement age, fixed at the point we first opened our SRS account. Today, the statutory retirement age is 63, but this is set to increase to 65 by about 2030. For those that opened their SRS accounts before 1 July 2022, their statutory retirement age remains at 62. As we mentioned above, we can also make withdrawals from our SRS account before our statutory retirement age by incurring certain penalties. On the SRS scheme, there is also no age cap for when we must start our withdrawals. However, after we start making withdrawals, we should typically withdraw our funds within 10 years. We may choose not to withdraw the entire amount, but any amount not withdrawn within the 10-year period will be subject to 50% income tax in the last year.

On CPF LIFE, we will only receive the payout we are eligible for, based on our retirement sum and the CPF LIFE plan – Standard, Basic or Escalating – that we have selected. There’s no room to withdraw more, but we can put back withdrawals into CPF LIFE if we wish. On the SRS scheme, we can withdraw as much or as little as we want. We can also adjust the amount yearly as required. We just also have to consider our tax liabilities and the 10-year withdrawal window.

You Can Go Beyond CPF And SRS To Safeguard Your Retirement Making top-ups to our CPF Special Account and our SRS account are just two ways we can build our retirement nest egg. We can also invest more on our own outside of these two retirement schemes. We should also think of our CPF account and SRS account as complementary, rather than fixate on choosing one over the other, especially because there are different restrictions on each account.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING CPF LIFE VS Retirement Sum Scheme (RSS): What’s The Difference? Is CPF LIFE really better than the old Retirement Sum Scheme? by On the back of rising life expectancy in Singapore, the CPF Lifelong Income For the Elderly (LIFE) was introduced in 2009. Since then, the average life expectancy of Singaporeans has increased to 83.0 years today from 81.4 years. CPF LIFE replaced the old Retirement Sum Scheme (RSS) as the default CPF payout scheme for Singaporeans in our retirement. While most younger Singaporeans and PRs will automatically find themselves on the CPF LIFE scheme when they turn 55, the Retirement Sum Scheme is the main retirement payout plan for those born before 1958. This group is above 65 years old in 2023. There will remain pockets of the senior population who will be on the Retirement Sum Scheme, either because they were already on it before CPF LIFE was introduced, or find that they still qualify for it. Who Will Still Be On the Retirement Sum Scheme? There are three main groups of people who will find the Retirement Sum Scheme still relevant to them today. As mentioned, the first group includes seniors who were already receiving payouts from the Retirement Sum Scheme before CPF LIFE was introduced in 2009. When CPF LIFE was launched, they had the option to switch to the new scheme. Those who didn’t are still on the Retirement Sum Scheme today. These members can still decide to switch to CPF LIFE at any time before they turn 80. The second group of people are those who were born before 1958, but have not yet begun their Retirement Sum Scheme withdrawals. This is because CPF LIFE was launched with an auto-inclusion criteria that required only those born in 1958 or after to mandatorily join the scheme, if they are able to. This second group of people who were born before 1958 can choose to remain on the Retirement Sum Scheme or switch over to CPF LIFE. Read Also: Turning 55? Here’s what you should Consider when planning your CPF withdrawals The third group is those who fail to meet the CPF LIFE auto-inclusion criteria as stated on the CPF website: – You are a Singaporean Citizen or Permanent Resident;\n",
      "– Born in 1958 or after; and\n",
      "– Have at least $60,000 in your Retirement Account when you start your monthly payouts Those most likely to be unable to meet the auto-inclusion criteria for CPF LIFE may include housewives and those unable to work, as well as freelancers, self-employed and business owners in certain instances. In the coming decades, Platform Workers will not fall through this gap anymore, as they will also have to make mandatory CPF contributions (and receive CPF contributions from their Platform Companies). Do note that while certain groups of people will not automatically be on CPF LIFE, they still retain the option of joining CPF LIFE if they want to. Before going into the differences between CPF LIFE and the Retirement Sum Scheme, let’s first understand how similar they are. CPF LIFE And Retirement Sum Scheme Are Both Providing Monthly CPF Payouts In Our Retirement While the payout eligibility age was increased from 62 to 65 in 2007, around the same time as the introduction of CPF LIFE, it should not be seen as a difference between the two schemes. This is because the change affected everyone, including those who remained and those who will enter the Retirement Sum Scheme going forward. Both CPF LIFE and the Retirement Sum Scheme are meant to sustain us in our retirement by providing monthly payouts derived from our CPF account balances. As the life expectancy of Singaporeans increase, we may expect the retirement age and the payout eligibility age to increase as well. Both schemes also require us to set aside a retirement sum in our Retirement Account (RA). When we turn 55, our combined CPF Ordinary Account (OA) and Special Account (SA) balances will be funnelled into the newly created RA. For those who turn 55 in 2024, the Full Retirement Sum (FRS) will be $205,800. If we have more than the FRS in our OA and SA, we can either choose to withdraw the remaining sum or contribute more to our RA up to the Enhanced Retirement Sum (ERS) of $308,700. Even if we are not able to contribute the FRS, we can still choose to withdraw a maximum of $5,000 from our Retirement Account balances at 55. In both schemes, we can start receiving our monthly payouts from our payout eligibility age, which is currently 65, to tide us through our retirement. Also Read: Here’s What Your CPF Full Retirement Sum Might Look Like When You’re 55 CPF LIFE VS Retirement Sum Scheme Most working adults today will automatically be enrolled in CPF LIFE. Currently, the only way for younger Singaporeans and PRs to enter the Retirement Sum Scheme is to fail to meet the CPF LIFE auto-inclusion criteria. Even then, you can still opt to join CPF LIFE. As a recap, here’s the CPF LIFE auto-inclusion criteria: Source: CPF In our Retirement Account (RA), our balances currently earn an annual interest of 4.04% per annum (p.a.), with the first $60,000 earning an additional 1% p.a. in interest, and the first $30,000 earning an extra additional 1% p.a. When we reach our payout eligibility age of 65, we can start receiving monthly payouts from either scheme. We can also choose to defer our payouts until we reach a maximum of 70 years old. After understanding the similarities, we can better understand the five differences between the CPF LIFE Scheme and the Retirement Sum Scheme. However, do note that some of the differences no longer apply to the majority of those who enter the Retirement Sum Scheme today, as they would not have sufficient balances in their RA. If they did have sufficient balances, they would have been automatically put on the CPF LIFE scheme. #1 How We Receive Payouts The biggest difference comes from how we receive our monthly payouts under the two schemes. Under the Retirement Sum Scheme, we receive payouts from our Retirement Account balances. We will still be able to monitor and track our funds within our Retirement Account. Under CPF LIFE, once we start receiving our monthly payouts, it means we have contributed our funds into the CPF LIFE scheme. For many of us, this means the bulk of our funds no longer sit within our Retirement Account, and we receive our monthly payouts from the CPF LIFE scheme, which we have contributed to. As a side note, on CPF LIFE, those who opt for the Basic Plan will continue withdrawing their funds from the Retirement Account, while having to contribute an upfront premium to CPF LIFE to continue their withdrawals from the scheme should they live beyond what their Retirement Account can distribute. Read Also: How Long Does It Take To Beat The “Break-Even” On Your CPF LIFE Plan? #2 Withdrawal Age On both the CPF LIFE scheme and Retirement Sum Scheme, the withdrawal age commences at 65. However, as explained above, this wasn’t always the case as the withdrawal age on the old Retirement Sum Scheme was 62 in 2007. On both CPF LIFE and the Retirement Sum Scheme, the maximum age we are able to defer our monthly payouts to is when we turn 70. Again, this was not always the case as there was no limit to how long we could defer our monthly payouts on the Retirement Sum Scheme in the past. In other words, opting to stay on the Retirement Sum Scheme today, instead of opting to join CPF LIFE doesn’t allow you to make your withdrawals any earlier or later. This isn’t really a difference between the two schemes as the policies could have been effected even if CPF LIFE never existed. #3 Buying A Property On the Retirement Sum Scheme, we were able to purchase a property with our Retirement Account balances up to the Basic Retirement Sum, which is half of the Full Retirement Sum. We were able to do this at any point we wished, primarily because our funds still reside in our Retirement Account as opposed to within the CPF LIFE scheme. On CPF LIFE, our balances in our Retirement Account is contributed into CPF LIFE when we start making monthly withdrawals, typically when we turn 65 and up to the time we turn 70. While we can continue using our Retirement Account balances to purchase a property until that point, this flexibility is gone once our Retirement Account funds is contributed into CPF LIFE. #4 Interest Returns From CPF Both funds that are contributed to CPF LIFE or kept in Retirement Sum Scheme earn interest from the government. However, the interest returns are paid to us in a slightly different method. The difference is that on the Retirement Sum Scheme, the interest is paid into our Retirement Account Balances. On CPF LIFE, funds that are contributed to the scheme earn an interest that is paid to the Lifelong Income Fund, which is meant to continue giving monthly payouts to those who live longer. One important point to note is that while we do not receive the interest payments on funds contributed to CPF LIFE directly, our financial futures are secured, especially if we live beyond how long our funds would have lasted. Secondly, if we pass on early, our beneficiaries will not be taking out from the CPF LIFE scheme less than what we have put in, minus the payouts we have received under CPF LIFE. We can understand this from the article on CPF LIFE “benefit illustration” that we researched below. Read Also: Complete Guide To Understanding The “Benefit Illustration” Of CPF LIFE Payouts #5 Lifelong Payouts Another important difference between the two retirement schemes is that CPF LIFE offers the security and peace of mind that regardless of how long we live, we will continue receiving our monthly payouts. The fact is that Singaporeans have one of the longest life expectancies in the world. According to government statistics, 1 in 3 Singaporeans aged 65 today will live beyond 90, and there are also close to 1,200 centenarians in Singapore today, compared to just 50 in 1990. On the Retirement Sum Scheme, our monthly payouts only last until our Retirement Account balances are depleted. Based on the RA interest rate of 4%, our funds is typically meant to last up to age 85. However, as we earn an additional 1% p.a. on the first $60,000 and an extra additional 1% p.a. on our first $30,000, payouts under the Retirement Sum Scheme may last until about the age of 90*. The government announced that all CPF members under the Retirement Sum Scheme who turn 65 from 1 July 2020 will come under new payout rules, which spreads payouts to age 90, rather than 95. The intention is for us to receive higher payouts each month. During Budget 2023, the minimum monthly payouts for those on the Retirement Sum Scheme was also increased from $250 to $350. This came into effect from 1 June 2023, and will go on until their Retirement Account savings are depleted. It seems like the CPF LIFE is really, really forward-thinking as it provides payouts for life unlike the Retirement Sum Scheme which has a limited duration. Of course, we also have to note that CPF LIFE was introduced in 2009, while the extra additional 1% on the first $30,000 of our Retirement Account balances was introduced only in 2016.

Source: CPF (Example is based on 2020 figures, and should apply similarly to 2024 figures) Ensure You Have A Plan For Your Retirement We need to ensure that our retirement plans are not solely reliant on our CPF funds. While it provides a good safety net, we can see that there have been adjustments to the scheme in the past, and there is nothing to say that in 30 years, when some of us may be retiring, the scheme will still look the same as it does today. Of course, we’re not saying it will disappear altogether! In fact, the scheme will very likely exist – whether in the current form or an updated form. What we’re saying is that we need to ensure that we have supplementary plans to secure a comfortable retirement for us and our spouse. Regardless of whether you were an older Singaporean on the Retirement Sum Scheme or a younger Singaporean who will join the CPF LIFE scheme, we can see that the government is trying to tweak the schemes to offer greater security in retirement solutions for Singaporeans. While some label this as “shifting goal posts”, the alternative is that we retire and find that the amount we set aside is not able to keep up with the cost of living. CPF LIFE or Retirement Sum Scheme payouts are also meant to provide a basic retirement for Singaporeans and PRs. The majority of us are living beyond this basic retirement level and will need to put in place other sources of retirement income in order to continue our current standard of living.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg MONEY 15 Volunteering Roles For The Elderly To Keep Themselves Engaged Seniors can keep their minds engaged and learn new skills while volunteering for a good cause. by By the year 2030, the number of Singaporeans aged 65 years and above will make up one quarter of the total population in Singapore, according to the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY). As an aging population, we will have more elderly seniors in our midst. Besides striving for a healthy body, mental health is also of importance to retirees as they transition from spending most of their time working to now being left independently to spend their time. This could introduce issues such as an increased sense of loneliness, depression, self-isolation and more. One way some retirees can choose to cope with this transition would be through volunteering. Volunteering helps one to remain active through social engagement and completing tasks. Moreover, this is a good way for seniors to put whatever skills they have learnt in their previous jobs to good use as well. With such benefits, here are volunteering places seniors can consider to keep their minds engaged and at the same time, lend a hand to society.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg BRANDED CONTENT Singapore Retirees Share How They Maintain Their Lifestyle Amid Inflation Protect your retirement against inflation with the Escalating Plan by This article was written in collaboration with CPF. All views expressed in this article are the independent opinion of DollarsAndSense.sg based on our research. DollarsAndSense.sg is not liable for any financial losses that may arise from any transactions and readers are encouraged to do their own due diligence. You can view our full editorial policy here. Over the past year, rising inflation has been a worrying concern for many. As the general level of prices for goods and services increases, it erodes the purchasing power of consumers. Higher inflation can have adverse effects on individuals, particularly those with fixed incomes, as they might struggle to maintain their standard of living. One group that may be more affected by inflation than others would be retirees. Unlike working adults, who can seek to earn higher wages, retirees may not have the avenue and ability to cover the shortfall as easily. Housing And Healthcare Are Not The Primary Concerns With the high homeownership rate in Singapore, many retirees have their own place. This eliminates concerns about covering housing expenses in their retirement years. With MediShield Life, concerns over healthcare costs are also reduced, as retirees are assured that large medical bills will be covered. Additionally, MediSave can also be used to pay for MediShield Life premiums or other eligible expenses. With both housing and healthcare being less of a concern, the main expenses for retirees would be in managing their day-to-day. This can typically be broken down into two areas. Essential spending and discretionary spending. Essential spending refers to living expenses needed for daily life, such as food, groceries, transport, utilities and telecommunication needs. Discretionary spending is the additional expenses to maintain the type of lifestyle that one desires. This could include overseas travel, hobbies or on preferences regarding dining out at hawkers or more fancy and expensive restaurants. When inflation occurs, both essential and discretionary spending increases. So how do retirees in Singapore maintain their lifestyle amid inflation? Do they need to make changes to their lifestyles after retiring? To better understand this topic, we spoke to them to find out how they are coping. Counsellor Who Keeps Herself Occupied During Retirement Jenny (not her real name) (age 71) was a school counsellor who stopped working full-time last year at the age of 70. Today, she works part-time holding a similar role in the school. Due to her work arrangement, Jenny only chose to commence her CPF Lifelong Income For the Elderly (CPF LIFE) payout at 70 with the Escalating Plan. For Jenny, retirement is not daunting for her as she is assured that she can rely on her CPF LIFE Escalating Plan – a longevity insurance annuity scheme. This plan not only provides her with lifelong monthly payouts, but also gives her a 2% increment in her monthly payouts each year, which helps her cope with inflation. As such, Jenny did not have to make any spending adjustments since she stopped full-time work. Based on her rough estimate, she shared that, “CPF LIFE Escalating Plan’s payout covers most of my expenses.” For those of us approaching retirement, it is useful to know how much we need for our retirement based on our living expenses today. To do that, we can use CPF’s tool, the CPF LIFE Estimator to help estimate this. It helps to estimate the amount of retirement savings we need to achieve the desired monthly payout. For example, a 55-year-old female who wants to receive a monthly payout of $1,000 from the age of 65 should set aside $170,000 today (at age 55) in her Retirement Account. With compound interest, the amount of $170,000 in her Retirement Account will grow to about $255,000 by the time she is 65 years old.  Table 1, Source: CPF LIFE Estimator Assuming her desired payout is higher at $1,210, she will need to set aside about $207,000 at the age of 55 and this can be done by topping up her CPF Retirement Account with $37,000 (see table 2) today. This will allow her to grow her savings to achieve her desired payout. If her preference is to receive higher payouts, the slider within the CPF LIFE Estimator can be used to simulate how much CPF savings she will need at the age of 65 and the additional CPF top-ups she will be required to make.  Table 2, Source: CPF LIFE Estimator She can also protect herself against inflation with the CPF LIFE Escalating Plan as the payout will increase at 2% every year for life, (determined based on historical long-term inflation rates). This means, at age 85, she can expect to get $1,800 (see table 2). Like Jenny, CPF members who don’t want to commence their monthly payout at age 65 can choose to defer it till 70. By doing so, based on the CPF LIFE Estimator, their monthly payout will increase by about 7% for each year that they choose to defer the commencement of payout. Therefore, a base payout of initially $1,000 at age 65 (seen in table 1) would increase to $1,370 (see table 3) if CPF members do choose to defer the commencement of their payout till the age of 70.  Table 3, Source: CPF LIFE Estimator For Jenny, living a “simple lifestyle” helps her manage any worries about inflation. She shares with us that she “does not indulge”. Her preference is to cook and eat healthy meals at home. To cope with inflation, Jenny also chose to give up on car ownership and prefers to use public transport as she qualifies for the Senior Citizen Concession Card which allows her to commute for as little as 61 cents. She also reduced her overseas travel, particularly to exotic countries that do tend to cost more than countries in Asia. Even though choosing the CPF LIFE Escalating Plan means starting at a lower level, the increase in payout each year will allow Jenny to cope with inflation, especially if she chooses not to work part-time in the future. Jenny believes in living modestly, while trying her best to keep healthy by eating right and exercising well, is vital for her to have a happy retirement. Self-Employed Person Who Prefers The Escalating Plan For Retirement Adam (not his real name) (age 71) was a self-employed person who retired two years ago after closing his business due to COVID-19. Unlike salaried employees, self-employed persons in Singapore are only required to contribute to their MediSave Account if they have a net trade income of more than $6,000 a year. However, to prepare for retirement, Adam chose to make voluntary contributions to his CPF account during his working years. As a result, Adam doesn’t have to worry about his daily expenses today. Instead, he relies on his CPF LIFE Escalating Plan payout, which he finds sufficient to fully cover his monthly expenses, and would also protect his purchasing power against inflation. He also chose to defer his CPF LIFE payouts till age 70, as he knew that for each year that he deferred, his payouts will increase by up to 7%. According to Adam, his current lifestyle today is comparable to his pre-retirement spending. Thanks to his monthly CPF LIFE payout, he does not have to make any spending adjustments during retirement. While inflation isn’t a concern for him as he “doesn’t spend unnecessarily”, Adam is aware that the annual increment would help retirees like him preserve the purchasing power of their monthly payouts and give them peace of mind. Adam has also found easy ways to reduce his expenditure without having to lower his lifestyle. For example, with more time at hand today, he shared that he uses promotional sales to stock up on things he needs. He travels lesser these days and relies on public transport most of the time to get around. Adam’s advice to younger individuals who are worried about their retirement is to “spend within your means and save for rainy days.” Read Also: Saving For Your Future: Should You Max Out Your CPF Voluntary Contributions Every Year? While some retirees may have other source of income such as rental properties or investment that acts as a hedge against inflation, both Jenny and Adam do not have such source of income. As such, it makes sense for them to be choosing the CPF LIFE Escalating Plan. With rising life expectancy, more retirees may find the Escalating Plan enticing. With the Escalating Plan, monthly payouts increase by 2% for as long as we live and this provides the assurance that we have long-term income protection against inflation. Based on the CPF LIFE Estimator, a $1,000 a month payout at age 65 will increase to $1,490 (about 49%) by age 85. The amount increases to $1,820 by the age of 95 (see table 4).  Table 4, Source: CPF LIFE Estimator Value Our Health, As Much As Our Wealth One of the recurring themes brought up by both Adam and Jenny was how vital it is for one to have good health if they wish to enjoy retirement. In fact, many of the retirees we spoke to were more concerned about their health rather than their wealth. A common piece of advice we received was to strive to be as active as possible during retirement. When a person stops working, it’s easy to become inactive and live a sedentary lifestyle. Thus, many retirees deliberately find ways to keep themselves active, both physically and mentally. Ultimately, for one to have a fulfilling retirement, both health and wealth must go hand-in-hand. This is the first of a three-part content series where we will focus on the CPF LIFE schemes, why CPF members decided on the CPF LIFE plans that they are on, and how they can be empowered with the knowledge to make informed decisions to live a fulfilling and secure retirement. 4 STOCKS THIS WEEK Singtel (Z74); StarHub (CC3); NetLink (CJLU): Local Telcos Dividend Yield And Share Price Performance BRANDED CONTENT Cashback Vs Miles: How To Enjoy The Best Of Both Worlds MONEY Complete Guide To Multi-Currency Accounts And Wallets In Singapore [YouTrip, Revolut, Wise, DBS My Account, UOB Mighty FX And More] INSIGHTS 7 International Rankings That Singaporeans Enjoy PROPERTY En Bloc Deal: 3 Ways You Can Still Not Make Any Money COLUMNS 8 Things You Need To Know Before Heading To The Money Changer BRANDED CONTENT Why Homeowners Should Avoid Overspending on Their HDB Flats MONEY 11 Joints Savings Account To Open With Your Spouse Or Parents BONDS AND FIXED INCOME Step By Step Guide To Buying T-Bills Online Using Your CPF OA Savings ESTATE GUIDE Neighbourhood Estate Guide: Rediscovering Jurong East, The Regional Centre Of The West                     Copyright © 2019 DollarsAndSense. \n",

      "DollarsAndSense.sg RETIREMENT PLANNING Withdrawing Your SRS Savings: Here’s Why You Need To Be Tactical About Withdrawals After Investing If our investments do well, we may see ourselves incurring taxes during our retirement. by The Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) encourages us to save more for our retirement. While we already have CPF savings – which we can grow through both mandatory contributions from our salary and optional top-ups – the SRS is a purely voluntary scheme. There are two main benefits of contributing to our SRS account. Firstly, we receive annual dollar-for-dollar tax relief on up to $15,300 for Singaporeans and PRs, and up to $35,700 for foreigners working in Singapore. This is also the maximum we can contribute to our SRS each year. The SRS scheme is also flexible in that we can contribute as much or as little as we want, up to the annual cap. There is no requirement to contribute regularly – we can do so whenever we want. This can help us with income tax planning purposes. We may want to contribute an amount that puts us into a lower income tax bracket in certain years, and not in other years. Read Also: Complete Guide To Personal Income Tax Brackets In Singapore You Have To Invest Your SRS To Grow Your Funds In order to grow our SRS contributions, we have to invest it. This is unlike making a CPF contribution, which automatically earns a return of between 2.5% to 4.0% per year. If we don’t invest our SRS funds, we will only earn a negligible bank interest rate. For those who don’t have the financial knowledge or are not keen to invest on our own, we can use a robo-advisory platform like Endowus to help invest our SRS savings. With rising interest rates, we can also opt to buy treasury bills (T-bills), which is currently paying close to a 4% interest return, or the Singapore Savings Bonds (SSB), which is paying slightly above 3.0% per annum over 10 years. The point of opening our SRS account is to see it grow for your retirement adequacy. However, as our contributions accumulate and investments grow, we need to start planning for withdrawals as well. Without proper planning, we may be left with a hefty tax bill in our senior years. Read Also: 10 Investments You Can Make With Your Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) Account Restrictions On Your SRS Withdrawals While the SRS is a useful tool to build a bigger retirement nest egg, we need to note some of the restrictions on making withdrawals. This will also provide a guide on maximising the scheme for ourselves. #1 Withdrawals Before Your Statutory Retirement Age Incur Penalties SRS contributions are reversible. We can withdraw any amount at any time we wish. However, there is a 5% penalty on withdrawals (and 100% tax obligation on withdrawals) if we withdrawals before reaching the statutory retirement age prevailing at the time of our first SRS contribution. The current statutory retirement age is 63, but this is set to increase to 65 by about 2030. So, it will make sense to start your SRS account now even if you don’t intend to use it immediately. This will lock in our “prevailing statutory retirement age” at 63. If we ever decide to start using the SRS more seriously, we have the flexibility to start withdrawing at an earlier age. Note that the statutory retirement age in Singapore has already increased from 62 to 63 from 1 July 2022. Read Also: CPF Top-Ups VS SRS Top-Ups: Which Should You Choose? #2 Only Half Your Withdrawals Will Be Subject To Income Tax While we receive dollar-for-dollar tax relief on our SRS contributions today, our tax responsibilities on the contributions do not disappear. It is simply deferred to our senior years, at a 50% tax concession rate. I.e. only 50% of any SRS withdrawals that we make after our statutory retirement age will be subjected to income tax. For example, if we withdraw $40,000 in a year during our retirement, we will have to pay income tax on $20,000. If this is our only source of income, then we may not end up paying any income tax. However, we may still have to pay income tax if we have other forms of income, that we need to pay income tax on. When considering this, it’s important to note that we will be taxed on our entire SRS savings, which includes both our actual SRS contributions and  any investment returns that we generate over the years. Thus, if our investments grow a lot, we may have a hefty tax bill waiting for us. This is a great “problem” to have though. #3 You Have A 10-Year Withdrawal Period We can start withdrawing our SRS funds without penalties and at the 50% tax concession rate after our statutory retirement age. There’s no fixed starting period as well – i.e. we don’t have to start withdrawing at 62, 63 or 65 or 70 or at all. However, once we make our first SRS withdrawal, we have a 10-year withdrawal period. At the end of this window, all our SRS savings will be automatically withdrawn and we will have to pay income tax on 50% of the lump sum. #4 You Cannot Make More SRS Contributions Following Your First Withdrawal At or After Your Statutory Retirement Age   We can continue making SRS contributions even after we pass our statutory retirement age, as long as we do not make withdrawals. Withdrawals made before our statutory retirement age do not count. Read Also: How You Can Maximise Your Savings For Retirement Just By Using Your Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) Account Making Tactical Decisions On Your Withdrawals Understanding these restrictions will prepare us to better plan our withdrawals so we maximise tax savings on our SRS account. Here are some ways we should plan our SRS withdrawals to potentially make the best use of our tax savings. #1 Only Make SRS Withdrawals After Reaching The Statutory Retirement Age This is pretty straightforward. Any amounts that we withdraw from our SRS before hitting the statutory retirement age will incur a 5% penalty and be taxed at the 100% rate. If we want to be able to withdraw as early as possible, then funding our SRS account, even if it’s just $1, makes sense. Those who missed the 1 July 2022 deadline to open our SRS account have to follow the new statutory retirement age – which is 63-years-old. This is on track to increase to 65 by about 2030. #2 Only Withdraw From SRS When You Need It For Retirement Income As the SRS defers some tax liabilities to our senior years rather than eliminate it, we need to think about the best time to make withdrawals. If we’re still earning an income that can pay for our daily living expenses, there’s no need to rush to withdraw our SRS funds just because we’ve reached our statutory retirement age. Ideally, we would want only start making withdrawals from our SRS account once we stop working – and do not have a chargeable income. #3 Withdrawing $40,000 A Year For 10 Years In Singapore, we are not required to pay any tax on the first $20,000 of chargeable income. As only 50% of our SRS withdrawals will be considered chargeable income, we can withdraw up to $40,000 a year without having to pay any income tax. With certain tax deductions, we can even withdraw slightly more than $40,000. We also have a 10-year withdrawal period for our SRS balances. Any balance in our SRS account “is deemed to be withdrawn immediately after the end of the 10-year withdrawal period”. If we have over $400,000 ($40,000 x 10 years) in our SRS account, we may have to pay some taxes on our withdrawals at the end of our 10-year window. For example, if we contributed $5,000 to our SRS account each year for 33 years (i.e. from 30 to 63), and earned an interest of 6% per annum, we would accumulate close to $485,000 by the time we reach our retirement age. This means we would have to incur some income tax during our withdrawal phase. This also means that if we are able to maximise our tax deductions, beyond the first $20,000 of income, each year, we can end up saving a hefty amount on our tax bill.

If we have slightly over the $400,000-mark in our SRS account, we could try this hack to stretch our withdrawals to an 11th year. In the IRAS example hyperlinked above, it notes that someone who started their first withdrawal on 1 April 2020, will have their 10th and final withdrawal period ending between 1 April 2029 to 31 March 2030. IRAS also states that remaining SRS funds “is deemed to be withdrawn immediately after the end of the 10-year withdrawal period”. In their example, this looks like it falls on 1 April 2030. If we make our first withdrawal on 1 January 2023, and have our final withdrawal period on 1 January 2031 to 31 December 2031, the “immediately after” date may fall on 1 January 2032 – giving us one additional year to stretch our withdrawals.   For our example, having to withdraw $85,000 in the final year would incur an income tax of $725 based on current tax levels. If we do not plan our withdrawals properly, and find that we have $200,000 left in our SRS account in the 10thyear, we may find ourselves with a tax bill of over $3,000. #5 Liquidating Investments To Purchase An Annuity Product If we still have a significant amount of money left in our SRS account nearing the end of our 10-year withdrawal phase, we can choose to liquidate our investments to purchase annuities provided by insurance companies. This is because the 10-year period does not apply to investments in life annuities. This way, we continue to be able to receive payouts from our investments, while also enjoying the 50% tax concession applying throughout the duration of our life annuity – rather than be limited to the 10-year withdrawal period. Of course, we can also choose never to make any withdrawals, and thus are not bounded by the 10-year withdrawal period. However, we have to bear in mind that our beneficiaries will only see up to $400,000 of our SRS account balances exempt from tax. The remaining funds would still be subject to taxes at 50% rate. #6 Make A Final SRS Top-Up In The Year That We Want To Start Drawing Down One other thing we can do is that once we stop receiving an income and want to start making SRS withdrawals, we can make a final SRS top-up during that year even though we don’t have an income. This gives us an extra $15,300 in tax deductions during the year. This means, in the first year, we can withdraw about $70,000 and still not pay any taxes. We can also make withdrawals almost immediately after making the top-ups – so we’re not actually losing out in cashflow if we need it.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING What Is Lasting Power Of Attorney (LPA) And Why All Singaporeans Should Make One The importance and value of making a will is widely accepted and well-documented. In the same way, a Lasting Power Of Attorney is a logical component of a holistic estate planning process, complementing your existing will. by The importance and value of making a will are widely accepted and well-documented. We all understand that it makes sense to express your wishes when you’re still of sound mind and not under duress, so that your intent can be carried out when you’re no longer around. However, what happens in the event something unfortunate were to befall you, but you’re not quite dead? Surely you would still want all your assets to be managed by a trusted party, who can also take steps to protect your portfolio’s value. Your assets can then be used to sustain your treatment, or ensure your existing liabilities continue to be serviced, without having to trouble your loved ones. This is how a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) can be helpful in giving you peace of mind. Here’s how a LPA works and how it can help you. Read Also: 5 Stages In Life When It Makes Sense To Do A Financial Review What Is A Lasting Power Of Attorney (LPA)? A Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) is a legally-binding document that empowers someone you trust to manage your financial affairs for you (including your assets) in the event you lose the ability to do so for yourself. LPAs in Singapore are administered by the Office of the Public Guardian. Without an LPA, your loved ones will need to undergo the long, troublesome and expensive process of applying to the court to allow your financial and personal affairs to be managed on your behalf. An LPA is a logical component of a holistic estate planning process, complementing an Advance Medical Directive and existing will. Read Also: 5 Ways Your Family Can Lose A Lot Of Money If You Don’t Do Estate Planning Eligibility To Make A Lasting Power Of Attorney According to the Office of the Public Guardian, if you want to make an LPA, you must fulfil the following criteria: – You must have the mental capacity to make the LPA\n",
      "– Your donee(s) that you wish to appoint to act on your behalf must be willing\n",
      "– Both you and your donee(s) must be at least 21 years old and not be an undischarged bankrupt for LPAs for property and -personal affairs. For your LPA to be legally valid, you also need to register your LPA with the Office of Public Guardian. Lasting Power Of Attorney: Form 1 Or Form 2? When deciding to make an LPA, one of the decisions you need to make is whether to do use  “Form 1” or “Form 2” for your LPA. Form 1 is the most common and “default” type of LPA, giving the donee that you trust general powers with basic restrictions to act on your behalf. On the other hand, Form 2 requires a lawyer to draft the exact scope (or customised powers) that you wish to grant your donee to perform on your behalf. How To Submit An Online LPA Application Step 1: Choose your Donee(s). They must be above 21 and someone you can trust to make decisions on your behalf regarding your personal welfare, your property & affairs, or both. Step 2: Log in to the Office of the Public Guardian Online (OPGO) via Singpass, where you can draft your LPA. The donees can also accept their appointment via the OPGO. Step 3: Next, look for a LPA Certificate Issuer, such as Accredited Medical Practitioners, Practicing Lawyers and/or Registered Psychiatrists to certify your LPA and sign using Singpass digital signature. Step 4: Once the LPA is certified, it will be submitted to the OPGO for registration. When the digital LPA is accepted and registered, you and your donee(s) will be notified via SMS/email. There’s No Better Time To Make An LPA Than Now The fact that you’re reading this article shows that you have sufficient mental capacity. If you haven’t made an LPA, we hope that we’ve convinced you of their importance. As an additional bonus, application fees for the LPA Form 1 have been waived until 31 March 2026.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg HDB How Much Can You Save For Your Retirement If You Opt For A 4-Room BTO Flat Instead Of A 5-Room Flat? You can save more than $400,000 for your retirement by opting for a 4-room flat instead of a 5-room flat, within the same estate. by Buying a HDB flat is one of the biggest financial commitments that many Singaporeans will make in their lives. This means it is also a decision that we should not take likely. A Build-To-Order (BTO) flat is a popular choice for couples looking to get their first home. For applicants who prefer a larger living space, a 5-room flat may be more appealing compared to a 4-room flat. However, what some first-time homeowners may not realise is that the difference in pricing between flats of different sizes can be significant, and will inevitably affect how much you and your spouse can save up for your retirement. To help explain this concept, let’s take our reference from the latest HDB’s February 2023 Sales Launch. Tengah Brickland Weave (February 2023 Sales Launch) Tengah is a new, non-mature town that is still in the early development stage. It’s the first housing town to integrate housing projects with the area’s surrounding greenery and biodiversity. Brickland Weave sits along Brickland Road, which is at the edge of Choa Chu Kang Town and Bukit Batok Road. The development will also include amenities such as shops, eating houses, a residents’ network centre, and a 3-storey childcare centre. In addition to the extensive network of cycling and walking paths, residents can look forward to better connectivity to the west region via the Jurong Regional Line (JRL), bus services to the city centre, and other parts of the island via the Kranji Expressway (KJE). Read Also: Neighbourhood Estate Guide: Smart Forest Living In Tengah – Singapore’s First Car-Free HDB Town Centre The price range for a 4-room and 5-room flats for Tengah Brickland Weave are as follows:   For the purpose of illustration, we will make some assumptions in our calculation. Buying The Most Affordable 4-Room Flat Reasonably priced at $291,000, a couple who has $75,450 in their CPF OA will need to take a HDB loan of $215,550. Over a period of 25 years, their monthly mortgage repayment would be $978. They would make a total repayment of $293,365. If we include in the down payment, they would have paid a total of $368,815 for their 4-room flat. Buying The Most Expensive 5-Room Flat Within the same estate, the couple can also select the most expensive 5-room flat being offered. Priced at $503,000, the couple would have just enough CPF OA funds to cover the minimum 15% down payment ($75,450) required without forking out cash. They will need a HDB loan of $427,550. Over a period of 25 years, their monthly mortgage repayment would be $1,940. They would make a total repayment of $581,900. If you include in the down payment, they would have paid a total of $657,350 for their 5-room flat.   Over a period of 25 years, buying the bigger (and more expensive) 5-room flat could cost an additional $288,535, based on our assumptions. This excludes other cost areas associated with buying a larger flat, such as renovation costs and incurring higher maintenance fees such as higher property taxes and lower utility subsidies, among others. Read Also: Complete Guide To HDB Housing Grants In Singapore For Different Types Of Flats Losing Out On Potential Interest However, the possible difference in our retirement fund isn’t just $288,535. This is because, with the higher monthly mortgage repayment of $1,940 that we have to pay for our 5-room flat, we will be paying $962 more each month. If we assume that the full amount of $1,940 could be serviced using our CPF OA, it would also mean that we can have an extra $962 each month, if we choose to buy the more affordable 4-room flat instead. With a monthly difference of $962, and assuming an interest rate of 2.5% per annum, the couple would have accumulated $401,194 in their CPFOA over a 25-year period. This means they would get to enjoy an extra $200,597 each for their retirement. This difference could easily move them up from the Basic Retirement Sum to the Full Retirement Sum, or from the Full Retirement Sum to the Enhanced Retirement Sum.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg FAMILY PLANNING I Paid $99 For A Comprehensive Financial Planning Session With My Wife. Here Are 5 Things I Learned About Our Current Financial Health We have to save $366,000 for our two children in 20 years’ time. by While we have a lot in common, including two children, my wife and I are opposites when it comes to managing our finances. She’s more conservative, and prefers not to put her money into anything that she doesn’t understand. On the other hand, I only keep about 6 months’ worth of my expenses in cash and invest the rest of it. Typically, our financial commitments only converge when there is a shared goal. We’re both contributing towards a joint renovation/down payment savings fund for our HDB BTO flat each month. We’re also starting to invest in a portfolio for our children’s university education about two decades down the road. We also recognise the value of insurance to protect our and our children’s future. Apart from all that, we try to split bills at home evenly, and retain some autonomy in managing the rest of our money. A Bird’s Eye View Of Our Financial Plan This method of managing our personal finances can be empowering. However, there may also be some blindsides as we don’t know exactly what the other person’s longer-term financial goals are, besides the shared goals that we have. For us to get a macro view of our financial standing, I turned to MoneyOwl’s Comprehensive Financial Planning service. Technically, I signed myself up…and roped her in. Priced at $99 (valued at $535), the Comprehensive Financial Planning service comes with a 30-page detailed report of our financial standing and a two-hour consultation with a financial adviser. Editor’s Note: Following my session, another colleague at DollarsAndSense also signed up for MoneyOwl’s Comprehensive Financial Planning. She too detailed her experience in an article: Why We Should Review Our Personal Finances At Least Once? (I Paid $99 But You Don’t Have To) Taking An In-depth Look At Our Financial Health There’s a discovery phase where we need to spend about 20 minutes on a detailed online submission. This is meant to capture vital information required for MoneyOwl to create our personalised report. This is a methodical process and we can use MyInfo to save some time when creating our account.  For a start, we have to input information on our dependants. For me, this refers primarily to my children. Follow-up questions relate to whether I want to set aside funds for their education – I do, and get an instant pat on my back for starting to plan now. I suspect that this also serves another purpose, to lighten the impact of realising that I have to save more than $366,000 for their studies in about 20 years.  Next, we need to input information on our personal finances which include: our income, expenses, assets such as our home, savings, investments, CPF balances, and even other assets such as jewellery or cryptocurrencies. During this process, I’m encouraged to create a bad mood fund. Thinking about the $366,000 I need to save for my children’s education, and how nice it would have been to tap into a bad mood fund if I had one now – I decided to start a small one.  At the end of step 2, I’m basically told that I could set aside more for my bad mood fund, though not sure if my wife would agree… What’s nice is that we can also see how MoneyOwl derives this calculation.  The third part is to dust off our insurance policies to really understand what we’re covered or not covered for. This includes hospital plan, life protection, critical illness, disability income, and long-term care insurance. The inputs are straightforward, but we need to have the information on hand to save time. Being a writer at DollarsAndSense, readers would expect me to be on top of my finances. I’m glad to say that I finished this portion in good time. Plus, it helps that some of my personal insurance policies are with MoneyOwl – so they already have some information. At the end, I’m given a little nugget of information about how term life insurance can help me to cover gaps at a more affordable cost.  Moving on to the last step – whether I want to achieve Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE). I want to, but it’s going to be an uphill battle with $366,000 due in 20 years for my children’s university education. So, I input a more realistic desired retirement age: 65 years old.  I’m reminded of three must-haves for a comfortable retirement at the end of the discovery phase.  This was one of the better ways to spend 20 minutes as the exercise forced me to take stock of my personal finances across my daily life, investments and insurance. I was then directed to complete payment for the programme. After paying the $99, I got an email the next day to book our virtual consultation. A few days after booking the session, I also received the 30-page report. I would recommend everyone to spend some time going through this report in detail in order to make the most out of the virtual consultation to clarify anything you need to. I was also assigned an adviser with whom I already had some interactions with when I first purchased a policy from MoneyOwl. Financial advisers at MoneyOwl are fully-salaried employees, which means he is not remunerated based on the policies and/or investments we purchase from the session, if any at all. This is one way MoneyOwl ensures that all financial advice provided is unbiased and in their clients’ best interest.  I shared the report with my wife, and arranged to attend the session the following week. Read Also: 5 Things You Need To Know About The Newly-Launched Comprehensive Financial Planning Service By MoneyOwl, Which Combines Technology With Human Wisdom What We Learned During The Comprehensive Financial Planning Session We were greeted with a friendly face during our Comprehensive Financial Planning session. Shawn started off by explaining how MoneyOwl functions. I’m quite familiar with it, so this was more for my wife – who by the way, had no clue that the session would be documented in an article.  MoneyOwl brands itself as a bionic adviser. This means that they use both technology and human adviser to provide value for their clients. The information discovery phase and generation of the report was the tech and algorithms at work, while Shawn – as the human adviser – helped to provide context and answer our questions, giving us the perfect mix of the efficiency of technology and the familiarity of the human touch. The session with him was almost exactly 2 hours long, and here are 5 things my wife and I Iearned about our finances. #1 I Am Keeping Too Much In Cash & Should Invest More Instead Based on the report, I have been keeping too much of my money in cash. I currently have 15 months’ worth of expenses rather than 3 to 6 months. As the report suggests, it may mean that I am “not making my money work hard enough”. This is also where we should not solely rely on what the algorithm says. I informed Shawn that we are waiting for our BTO flat and part of the savings is earmarked for our renovation budget. He agreed that the main takeaway is that we should not just fixate on keeping X months’ worth of emergency savings, but to truly understand the specific reasons for keeping more or less than the recommended 3 to 6 months.  A secondary takeaway is that we may still not be making our funds work as hard as we can. Since our BTO key collection is going to be about 2 years away, we can invest part of it now while still continuing to save over the period. One safe way to invest such funds could be to use MoneyOwl’s WiseSaver, a low-risk cash management account. This way, we can earn higher interest rates than what the banks are paying, while not taking on too much investment risk. There’s also no lock-in period, so we can withdraw our funds whenever we need it – almost like an emergency savings fund. #2 Why Do I Have A Small Amount Of Debt? The job of the human adviser is to ask questions, especially when something doesn’t add up. Shawn has probably gone through dozens of these reports, developing a keen eye for anomalies. Even though it was in a very healthy range, he asked why I had a 1.4% debt-to-asset ratio.  This was something my wife hadn’t known about as well, hence it is important to go through such comprehensive financial planning sessions together.  The reason for this small debt is that I agreed to a balance transfer facility when one of my credit card operators offered me a promo over a call. The interest rate seemed attractive and it doubled up as research for potential article angles on DollarsAndSense. Shawn agreed that this isn’t a really big amount of loan so it should be manageable. I’m not sure if he approves of it though. #3 I Am On Course To Have Over $1 Million In My CPF (Not Really) MoneyOwl also has a CPF Analyzer tool we can use to estimate our future balances. Based on my current CPF balances, and considering that I earn the same amount until I turn 55, I am on course to accumulate $1.3 million in my CPF. Of this, about $519,000 will flow into my Retirement Account (RA). This is a number that MoneyOwl projects to be the Enhanced Retirement Sum (ERS) when I turn 55. In turn, this will give me close to $4,000 CPF LIFE monthly payouts when I turn 65. Of course, I would still have another over half a million dollars to drawdown on according to this calculation.  Sounds great. Unfortunately, this does not take into account that the bulk of my CPF Ordinary Account savings will be used to pay for my down payment when I eventually get my BTO keys in 2 years. I will also be utilising my OA balances to pay for my monthly home loan after that. While I will not have the $1.3 million CPF savings by the time I turn 55, it gave me an insight into how much I could have if I decide to use cash for my down payment and monthly instalments. It’s a lot of money, so i probably will not be able to do it. Nevertheless, this doesn’t have to be an all-or-nothing decision either, as I can use partial cash payments for my home, and allow my CPF savings to compound. Shawn says that he can regenerate the CPF balances with new inputs that weren’t captured during the discovery phase. #4 I Have A Critical Illness and Long-Term Care Coverage Gap In the report, it did not capture certain results entirely accurately – I suspect it could be because I didn’t save some of my inputs. (If you want to avoid this, do look through all your inputs one final time at the end of the discovery phase.) I actually have adequate life insurance coverage rather than no coverage (as shown in the screenshot below). My disability coverage gap is also relatively small, so there’s no urgency to cover it. It also looked like I had a big critical illness gap. However, since I purchased the plan from Shawn, he did a quick check and realised that the plan I was on had a $150,000 coverage upon late stage critical illness, while the base was lower. This means that the coverage gap I had was not as wide. But, I could also consider boosting this coverage. I also only had roughly half of my long-term care coverage needs. In Singapore, we currently have CareShield Life which covers part of our long-term care requirements. Shawn recommends that I plug this gap.  The benefit of the Comprehensive Financial Planning session was quite timely for us as well, since we just had our second child. Perhaps, this explains why I have some coverage gaps that need to be plugged. #5 Consider Involving Your Spouse Right From The Start (Rather Than During The Consultation Only) During most of the session, we spoke about my personal cash flow, CPF balances, and insurance coverage. This was interjected with Shawn trying to do some fact-finding with my wife to understand if what he was saying made sense from a family financial planning perspective. Shawn suggested that my wife could have taken a separate Comprehensive Financial Planning session on her own. This would have allowed her to provide her own inputs for CPF balance, insurance coverage, investments and others. What MoneyOwl can do after that is to compile the respective reports and organise a joint session for both spouses. By having both spouses intimately involved in the process, both parties benefit from a good understanding of their own personal finances, as well as gain an overview of their spouse’s finances. In our case, my wife saw what my finances looked like and I had a review of where my gaps were. However, I did not get an overview of my wife’s finances nor did she get an overview of her gaps. At the same time, Shawn’s recommendations were mostly specific to me. Nevertheless, one of the biggest takeaways for my wife was how she can start making her money work harder for her (and me). Since we got married almost six years ago, she has not invested a single cent of her savings. Instead, she’s been prudently growing the size of her savings account. In that time, she would have earned about 7% annual returns on her investment. In her lingo, she would have been able to buy a free YSL handbag each year rather than get $50 in bank interest rate. The chart below was really the main reason she overcame her reservations to investing. Since 1926, the stock market has been on an upward trajectory. And, in more recent times, staying invested in the market for more than 10 years will always give you a positive return regardless of when you invested.  MoneyOwl’s Dimensional portfolios provide a low-cost and low-barrier investing solution for ordinary investors. By removing trailer fees and commissions, and charging up to 0.6% in annual advisory fees, MoneyOwl underscores its commitment to act in our interest. We can also start off investing without much expertise or knowledge – as our portfolio of global equities and bonds will be built based on our risk appetite – and with as little as $50 a month. Editor’s Note: Relooking this chart is timely. The current market conditions are extremely volatile, and many of us may prefer staying out of the markets. However, if we study this chart, we can see that as long as we remain invested in a diversified portfolio for 10 years, we will always see a positive return. Couples who have young families, like us, could benefit from doing a Comprehensive Financial Planning session greatly as we may have insurance and investment gaps that we are not paying attention to. In our case, we just had our newborn, so it was a good time to review our financial health. My wife also abstains from investing – but we’ve overcome this thanks to the virtual session with Shawn.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg CPF How Much You Need In Your CPF Retirement Account (RA) At 65 To Afford The Average Retiree’s Expenses With CPF LIFE Payouts? Can you afford your retirement just with CPF LIFE payouts? by CPF LIFE is meant to provide a monthly lifelong payout throughout our retirement. While this is assuring, the question is whether we will receive enough CPF LIFE payouts to fund our retirement lifestyle. This is a difficult question to answer because everyone leads different lifestyles and is in different life circumstances. The best way to estimate the amount we will need in retirement is to look at some of the studies done in this area. Read Also: [Beginners’ Guide] Understanding CPF LIFE And Your Monthly Payouts When You  Retire In Singapore How Much Does An Average Retiree In Singapore Need Each Month? In the most recent Household Expenditure Survey 2017/18, we can find how much retiree households were spending based on their type of home. The average retiree household spent $1,154 per person a month. However, we can also see that the amount a retiree spends varies substantially between the type of homes they were living in. On average, retirees living in HDB flats spent about $867 a month. Retirees living in condominiums & Others spent $2,680, or about three times more than the average retiree living in an HDB flat. Interestingly, retirees living in condominiums & Others also spent more than their peers who lived in Landed Properties – who spent $2,175.   While it is understandable that those living in larger homes spend more, we should also account for inflation as these statistics are from 2017/2018. For the sake of this article, we will apply the 20-year average MAS core inflation rate of close to 2% to estimate what retirees may be spending today.   Of course, inflation has spiked this year. Going forward, we may need to account for a higher level of inflation annually. For this, it may be wiser to review the retiree household expenditure in the next Household Expenditure Survey, which will likely be for 2022/2023. Using the estimated figures for 2022, we can determine what retirees, aged 65 today, need in their CPF Retirement Account (RA) to receive such a similar CPF LIFE monthly payout. On average, a retiree living in an HDB flat will expect to spend an average of $939 monthly while a retiree living in private property will expect to spend more than double that amount. How Much Will A 65-Year Old Today Need In His Retirement Account (RA) To Afford The Average Household Retirement Expenses? Even though the figures above are segmented based on home types, there will still be situations where individuals live different lifestyles and face different circumstances. At best, these are estimates for how much retirees in the respective households should be spending. To find out how much retirees need in their Retirement Account (RA) to receive a payout worth the respective amounts, we can use the CPF LIFE Estimator tool. * Note that these figures are simply based on computations on the CPF LIFE Estimator tool. When setting aside our retirement sum, we are capped by the Enhanced Retirement Sum, which is $288,000 in 2022. This means that we cannot realistically receive the amount that average retirees living in Condominiums & Others and Landed Properties are spending. The CPF Life Estimator tool has also been revised, such that calculations above $500,000 are not provided. As we can see from the table above, retirees may need a substantial amount of money in their CPF account to be able to receive the average amount that they will spend in their retirement. In fact, the Basic Retirement Sum (BRS) in 2022 is $96,000, and will provide a CPF LIFE monthly payout of $570. This is much lower than what retirees, even in 1-room and 2-room HDB flats, may need for their living expenses. If you are relying on CPF Life payouts for retirement, you may need to aim to have at least the Full Retirement Sum (FRS) in your CPF at 65, which is $192,000 in 2022 – which will provide a CPF LIFE monthly payout of $1,070. Read Also: 1 Million at 65 Using CPF? Here’s The Math Behind The 1M65 Concept By living below our means and trying to contribute more to our CPF accounts when we can, we may be able to supercharge our CPF balances. This may allow us to pay our entire retirement expenses from CPF LIFE alone. If we are able to achieve that, it will give us peace of mind without worrying whether our other investments will deliver their expected returns. For those living in HDBs, their Retirement Account figures do look more achievable compared to those living in more luxurious housing types. For those living in condominiums and landed properties, their numbers can look unrealistic for them to accumulate more than $500,000 in their Retirement Account (RA) to achieve the average expenditure amount. This is not something we should be shocked to learn, as CPF LIFE has always stated that the intention is to provide payouts that are sufficient for a basic level of retirement. Nevertheless, by accumulating or supercharging our CPF accounts when we are young, we will be able to achieve balances of above $500,000 and even into the millions. Of course, those living in more luxurious homes also tend to have other assets they rely on for their retirement income. While we can contribute up to the Enhanced Retirement Sum (ERS) in our Retirement Account, and subsequently contribute to CPF LIFE, we can still withdraw the rest of our CPF  balances on a monthly basis.

On the Basic Plan and Standard Plan, we receive fixed payouts for the rest of our lives. On the Escalating Plan, we stand to receive a payout that increases by about 2% per annum each year. This should keep up with the 20-year MAS core inflation rate of close to 2% – with the caveat that inflation is spiking currently, and may rise above this level in the medium term.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING Matched Retirement Savings Scheme: How Seniors Can Get Dollar-For-Dollar Matching To Boost Their CPF Balances From 2021, eligible seniors can receive up to $600 per year for making cash CPF contributions. by This article was originally published on 26 October 2020 and updated to reflect the latest information. Singapore’s CPF system ensures that working Singaporeans and Permanent Residents set aside a portion of their earnings each month, in order for this money to form the foundation for monthly payouts during retirement – either through CPF LIFE or the CPF Retirement Sum Scheme. To provide a reference baseline, the government sets (and regularly reviews) milestone levels for our CPF savings: The Basic Retirement Sum (BRS), Full Retirement Sum (2 x BRS) and Enhanced Retirement Sum (3 x BRS). For those turning 55 in 2020, the Full Retirement Sum is $181,000. Read Also: Here’s What Your CPF Full Retirement Sum Might Look Like When You’re 55 Unfortunately, there is a segment of seniors who might still fall way short of even the BRS at the time of their retirement, which means they would be drawing on very modest payouts each month, which are grossly inadequate for even basic sustenance. According to the Ministry of Manpower, which administers CPF, about 435,000 seniors fall into this category. In order to encourage and support seniors in building up their CPF balances, and thus their retirement adequacy, the government announced in Budget 2020 the introduction of the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme (MRSS), which took effect from 2021. As of 7 January 2022, a total of $68 million MRSS grants has been credited to 117,000 eligible CPF members. 90% of these members received the maximum matching grant of $600. In 2022, 435,000 members are eligible for the MRSS, out of which 35,000 members are newly eligible. If you are one of these eligible members, you would have received a notification via e-mail, SMS, WhatsApp or post in January 2022 informing you of your eligibility. Here’s what you need to know about the scheme and to make the most of the government contribution matching and prevailing income tax deductions. What Is The Matched Retirement Savings Scheme (MRSS)? Matched Retirement Savings Scheme (MRSS) was announced in Budget 2020. Under the scheme, the government provides dollar-for-dollar matching to eligible seniors for voluntary CPF cash top-ups under the CPF Retirement Sum Topping-Up (RTSU) scheme, up to an annual limit of $600. MRSS would be implemented for 5 years – starting in 2021. You will be assessed yearly and notified by the CPF Board about your eligibility by February. Here are the eligibility criteria for MRSS: – Aged 55 to 70 (inclusive)\n",
      "– CPF Retirement Account savings is less than the prevailing Basic Retirement Sum (the BRS for seniors turning 55 in 2022 is $96,000)\n",
      "– Average monthly income of not more than $4,000\n",
      "– Annual Value (AV) of residence being not more than $13,000\n",
      "– Do not own more than one property MRSS is an incentive on top of the RTSU, however, even though RTSU contributions can be made in cash or transfers from your own Ordinary Account, MRSS matching is only applicable for cash top-ups. The cash top-ups can be made in a lump sum, or in smaller portions throughout the year, including via GIRO. At the end of each calendar year, the total topped-up amount will be computed, and the matching grant (capped at $600 annually) will be credited by the first quarter of the following year. MRSS grant payouts are given to seniors, so it does not matter who makes the cash top-ups – it can be seniors themselves, their loved ones, or even their employer. Those making top-ups would then be eligible for prevailing benefits of RTSU cash top-ups, such as income tax deductions. Read Also: Retirement Sum Topping-Up Scheme (RSTU) VS CPF Voluntary Contributions: What’s The Difference? MRSS Grant Matching Can Be Used With Existing RTSU Tax Deductions On top of the dollar-for-dollar matching provided by the government, you (or those topping up on your behalf) can also enjoy prevailing tax benefits for making RTSU contributions. The maximum tax relief on top-ups made to your own CPF RA or by employers on your behalf amount to $8,000 per calendar year. Those making top-ups to the CPF RA of their loved ones (parents, parents-in-law, grandparents, grandparents-in-law) can receive an additional $8,000 in tax reliefs per calendar year. This tax relief applies to top-ups to the CPF RA of your spouse/siblings if their income (from all sources) does not exceed $4,000 in the preceding year, or if they are handicapped (mentally or physically incapacitated). Note that the $8,000 tax relief limit for RSTU top-ups also includes any Medisave top-ups. The yearly personal income tax relief cap of $80,000 also applies to all tax reliefs claimed, including cash top-ups made under RSTU. Employers that make top-ups to the CPF RA of their employees will also receive full tax deductions on their top-ups. Read Also: How Easy Is It For Working Singaporeans To Meet The CPF Full Retirement Sum When They Reach The Age Of 55? Eligible Seniors Will Be Notified At The Start Of The Year As the eligibility for MRSS is assessed every year, you may be able to change your eligibility if your income changes or if you change your residence. Do note that the AV is based on your place of residence (as reflected on your NRIC), this means that if you move from your HDB to your child’s condominium (and change your NRIC address), you may no longer be eligible. For those who have not received the annual notification, you can also check your eligibility on CPF’s website.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING How Long Will It Take To Build A Desired Retirement Goal Just like how we can’t expect to run a 2.4km below 10 minutes without committing to a training regime, neither can we expect to realistically achieve $1 million in our retirement nest egg without first having a financial plan, and being disciplined in working towards this plan. by This article was written in collaboration with Prudential. All views expressed in this article are the independent opinion of DollarsAndSense.sg based on our research. DollarsAndSense.sg is not liable for any financial losses that may arise from any transactions and readers are encouraged to do their own due diligence. You can view our full editorial policy here. Saving $1 million for our retirement nest egg could be a milestone that many of us want to work towards. Just like how we can’t expect to run a sub-10 minutes 2.4km without committing to a training regime, neither can we expect to realistically achieve $1 million in our retirement nest egg without first having a financial plan, and being disciplined in working towards this plan. Whether it’s our fitness or financial goals, the approach we take towards achieving our goals has always been similar. Sounds easy? Well, that depends. #1 Set A Goal & Write It Down The first thing we need to do is to set our goal(s) correctly, and this needs to be a goal that makes sense for us and meets our aspirations. For example, accumulating $1 million by the time we retire could be a goal that some people may aspire towards. Alternatively, it could be getting passive income of $3,000 a month for ourselves by the time we retire (that’s my goal!). Some may need more if they aspire to travel often and enjoy the desired lifestyle during their retirement. Others may prefer to continue working part-time and thus, may not need as much money. Regardless of what our goals may be, they need to be aligned to what we want to achieve and while setting the right goals can give us a focal point, they have to be realistic as well. For example, aiming to run 2.4 km below 10 minutes could be an achievable goal for many people who are willing to train hard, eat right and adopt healthier daily living habits. Wanting to beat Soh Rui Yong’s 6 minute 53.18 seconds timing isn’t going to be as realistic. Writing down our goals (or documenting it in some other way) is equally important. The process of writing down our goals helps us to clearly process our thoughts. It also keeps us accountable for what we say we want to achieve. For financial goals, we can use an app such as the Pulse by Prudential which has the Wealth@Pulse component to help us start and set financial goals for ourselves.  I tried it out, and chose the option to set my goal to save for retirement. The first thing I had to do was input my target retirement age.  For me, this is 60.  Based on the income information which  I input earlier when I first downloaded Pulse, Wealth@Pulse provides some useful information on the type of lifestyle that I may prefer, and how much it would approximately cost each month. I chose the simple lifestyle because the amount required (about $3,000 a month) is what I envision I need to get by when I retire at 60, and when my kids and home mortgage are no longer expenses I need to worry.  #2 Have A Plan & Get Help If Required After setting our financial goals, the next thing is to formulate a plan that helps us achieve it. Any plans should take into consideration what we are already doing. For example, if we are in relatively good shape, then we may just need to tune up our training to achieve our fitness goals quickly. However, if we are out of shape, then it will take a lot more time and effort to hit our goals. This applies to financial goals as well. One clever thing about Wealth@Pulse is that it rightly considers our CPF monies to help us determine how much more we need to achieve our retirement goals.  With our CPF inputs, Wealth@Pulse can suggest to us whether we are on the right track to achieve our ideal retirement goals. If we are not, it also tells us how far off the target we could be.  From the screenshot above, the bad news is that solely based on CPF contributions alone, Wealth@Pulse suggests that it won’t be enough to fund the income I need for my desired retirement lifestyle. The good news though is that I am not completely off-track for my retirement as CPF alone can already give me more than 50% of what’s needed. However, I need to fund my retirement with other sources of income, and that may include my investment portfolio, rental properties and annuity plan. How long it takes for me to attain $1 million in savings, $3,000 a month in passive income or any other desired level of income that is needed for my retirement will depend on my saving and investment decisions today. But no matter what, I need to start planning for tomorrow today. While these are personal financial goals, the last thing we want to do is shy away from getting help when we need it. Similar to how a personal trainer can help develop a training plan to help us achieve our fitness goals, we can also engage a Financial Consultant to help us formulate a financial plan that will enable us to attain our retirement goals. The Wealth@Pulse on the Pulse app makes this easier by providing a“Call Me Back” option on the app to engage an experienced Prudential Financial Consultant to contact me for a more in-depth financial planning discussion.  I can choose to be contacted either via a call or email.  #3 Execute the Plan & Review It Regularly Once we have our financial plans in place, the final step is to execute. This is always easier said than done. To ensure our financial plans work, we may need to cut down on certain non-essential expenses to increase our savings each month, or to channel our savings to insurance plans across investments or savings. And we need to do this consistently over a long timeframe for it to work. As is usually the case, it’s only when we adopt more prudent financial habits and adapt our lifestyle that we can achieve our goals over the long-term. Reviewing our financial plan regularly is also important. Our financial goals may change during certain stages of our lives (e.g. when we have kids or start to earn more with a new job) and these always-evolving goals should be reflected in our plans. Just like how a personal trainer will help track our progress and motivate us, we can also engage a good and trusted financial consultant to help keep track of the progress of our financial planning, and to adjust the plan accordingly when required.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INSURANCE Retire Well Or Leave A Legacy? Why You Don’t Need To Choose One Over The Other Wanting to leave a legacy for the next generation doesn’t mean needing to compromise on our own retirement goals. by This article was written in collaboration with HSBC Life. All views expressed in this article are the independent opinion of DollarsAndSense.sg based on our research. DollarsAndSense.sg is not liable for any financial losses that may arise from any transactions and readers are encouraged to do their own due diligence. You can view our full editorial policy here. When it comes to retiring in Singapore, there are typically two main goals that people living in Singapore have. Retiring well is the first obvious goal. Given the high cost of living and the relatively luxurious lifestyle that many of us may be used to, retirees need to ensure they have enough passive income in their golden years. The other goal some retirees have is to leave a legacy for their children. This usually refers to what we leave behind, including our financial assets. This desire to leave a financial legacy while still having enough to retire well may appear to be contradictory goals. After all, retiring well is likely to incur more spending – implying that we may leave a smaller legacy to our children or grandchildren. For many Singaporeans, our CPF savings and HDB flats are the main instruments that we rely on to retire well while leaving behind a legacy. Through CPF LIFE, we receive a lifelong monthly income that can be used to cover basic living expenses during retirement. Due to the manner CPF LIFE payouts are structured, the tradeoff is that we may not have a substantial bequest of CPF monies, if any, when we pass on. For elderly Singaporeans who own and live in their HDB flats, leaving behind their flats is one way to leave a legacy. However, if our adult children already have their HDB flats or private properties, they can’t take over ownership of our flats, unless they sell their existing properties. Retiring Well & Leaving A Legacy Doesn’t Need To Be Mutually Exclusive Retirement Goals When we look at our CPF savings and HDB flats, it’s easy to think that retiring well and leaving a legacy are mutually exclusive retirement goals. However, this isn’t necessarily true. Using the right financial products, we can plan for a comfortable retirement, while ensuring that we leave a legacy for our children. Introducing Flexible, Long Term Saving-Focused Insurance Plan We don’t have to rely solely on our CPF accounts and HDB flats for our retirement and to grow wealth. Through flexible long term saving-focused insurance plans, we can grow our wealth and have the financial assurance we need for ourselves and the next generation. An example of such a product is the HSBC Life Wealth Builder. This product, which is a long-term endowment plan, can be used not only to supplement our own retirement adequacy, but also that of our children, or even grandchildren! The HSBC Life Wealth Builder covers life insured up to age 120 years and can be passed from one policyowner to another. While the plan constantly builds up cash value, policyowners can enjoy access to the cash value of your policy as and when it’s required to fund key milestones in life, be it for your retirement or when your child enters tertiary education.  Source: HSBC Life Wealth Builder Product Brochure The above figures are for illustrative purposes only and are based on Illustrated investment rate of return of 4.25% p.a. Bonuses are not guaranteed and actual benefits payable will vary according to the performance of the participating fund. In the first example above, we can see that despite withdrawing S$50,000 across three different life stages, Sarah still enjoys a maturity benefit that is more than 8x of the original premiums (S$10,000 annually for 5 years) that she paid by the end of the premium term. With a coverage lasting up to age 120 year old of the (first) life assured, the HSBC Life Wealth Builder allows parents to buy this long-term endowment plan for themselves, and subsequently transfer ownership of the plan to your child if you want. Doing so will enable parents to stretch the lifespan of this policy beyond what you can reasonably expect yourselves to live.  Source: HSBC Life Wealth Builder Product Brochure The above figures are for illustrative purposes only and are based on Illustrated investment rate of return of 4.25% p.a. Bonuses are not guaranteed and actual benefits payable will vary according to the performance of the participating fund. In the second example above, we can see that a father, John purchases the plan at age 35  via a single premium of S$100,000  and subsequently, transfers the ownership of the policy to his son Zack through a will. In the illustration, having held the plan for a total of 74 years (across both father and son), the total payout when the son passes on at age 80 is S$1,480,664, more than 14x the original premium (S$100,000) paid. The example above assumes that neither the father nor son make any withdrawals from the plan contributing to the accrual of a larger lump sum payout upon the insured event happening. However, if they had preferred, both policyowners would have been able to withdraw from the plan as and when they needed perhaps to fund any shortfall in their respective retirement or for any other milestone life stages. In this way, the HSBC Life Wealth Builder can give you, as parents, potentially the best of both worlds. As you start saving and contributing towards this plan at a younger age, the amount accumulated in the policy will not only grow over time, but can also be used to fund your retirement, and serve as a legacy that can secure your children’s retirement. Besides the flexibility in making withdrawals, other advantages of the plan are that policyowners can choose a premium term that fits your payment preference. This can be a one-time single premium, or over 5, 10 or 15-year premium term. Do note that cash value, as illustrated in the plan, comprises of both guaranteed and non-guaranteed bonuses. If the policyowner suffers from Total and Permanent Disability (“TPD”), the remaining premiums will be waived. Start Planning From A Young Age One of the key reasons why the HSBC Life Wealth Builder can be used to fund both your retirement and to secure a legacy for your children is because it utilises time to work in its favour. With a coverage of (first) life insured to 120 years old, the plan gives you the option to build wealth over multiple generations, and not just during your lifetime. At the same time, unlike investing in an expensive property and locking up your retirement nest egg, such a plan allows you to fund your retirement today, while leaving a legacy for the future. If you are keen to consider this product, you can find out more details about this plan on the HSBC Life website. To better understand how this product may be suitable for you, we strongly recommend that you speak to a HSBC relationship manager who can share more details about this plan. Make an appointment or visit your nearest HSBC branch to apply in person.   Note: Based on an illustrated investment rate of return of 3.00% p.a., the total potential cash value for: Scenario 1: If Sarah makes no withdrawal: Cash value at age 70 is S$126,627, full surrender value at age 85 is S$203,008, maturity benefit at the end of the policy term is S$642,584. If Sarah makes the above withdrawals: Full surrender value at age 85 is S$45,460, maturity benefit at the end of the policy term is S$143,895. Scenario 2: Cash value when John is age 70: S$231,654, cash value when Zack is age 70: S$591,250, death benefit when Zack passes on at age 80: S$827,980.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg MONEY Here’s Why You Should Top Up Your Parents’ CPF Retirement Account Instead Of Giving Parents’ Allowance Be filial and financially savvy by Filial piety is one of the Asian values that have been inculcated in most Singaporeans from young. One of the unstated but silently expected things we have to do as adult children is to give our parents allowance. To sidestep the potential landmine of whether you should or should not give an allowance to your parents (which will depend on the relationship you have with your parents and many other factors), this article assumes that you are intending to give your parents an allowance and are looking for the best way to do so. One rationale for giving parents allowance is to provide from them in their older years: a form of retirement planning. Yet, is giving your parents an allowance directly the best way to provide for them as they age? If your parents are like mine and not reliant on your support, the allowance you are giving them is most likely just sitting in a bank account collecting dust (and minimal interest). Here are the reasons why you should top-up your parents’ CPF Retirement Account instead of giving them allowance directly Read Also: [Beginners’ Guide] Understanding CPF LIFE And Your Monthly Payouts When You Retire In Singapore #1 Topping Up Your Parents’ CPF Retirement Account (RA) Will Increase Their CPF LIFE Payouts And Actually Give Them More Instead of letting the money you give to your parents sit idle in a bank account, using the same amount to top-up your parents’ CPF RA will give you a better return on capital. Not only is CPF Life monies guaranteed by the government, but it also provides high, risk-free returns of up to 6% p.a. For example, you plan to give your parents a monthly allowance of $500 or a total of $6000 a year. Assuming that your mother is 65 years old this year and has a CPF RA balance of $100,000, topping up $6000 to her CPF RA will increase her CPF LIFE payouts from an estimated $545 to $576 to an estimated $574 to $607. This is an increase of about $30 a month, or $360 a year; a return of 6% per annum while retaining the capital of $6000 in CPF. If your parent is not yet 65, the top-ups will compound and give a higher return. For example, if you top up the same $6000 when your mother is 55 years old, the top-up will increase her CPF LIFE payouts from an estimated $641 to $689 to an estimated $674 to $725. This will be an increase of about $35 a month or $420 a year; a return of 7% per annum. Note: the examples are calculated using CPF LIFE Estimator and are based on CPF LIFE standard plan and topping up your mother’s account. As females receive a lower CPF Life payout than males, the numbers may be higher for topping up your father’s account.

CPF LIFE payouts are guaranteed for life. By topping your parents’ CPF RA, the payouts will continue for as long as your parents are alive, even in the unfortunate event where you are no longer able to continue giving an allowance. Additionally, you can be assured that the money is going to your parents and no one else. It is harder to scam someone of the entirety of their CPF RA than the cash in the bank. #3 You Will Enjoy Tax Deductions For Topping Up Your Parents’ CPF Retirement Account (RA) One major benefit of topping your parents’ CPF RA is the tax benefits. Under the Retirement Sum Topping Up Scheme (RSTU), you can top up your parents’ CPF RA and receive tax relief of up to $8,000 per calendar year. However, this tax relief is not per parent but for all top-ups made to your loved ones, including parents, parents-in-law, grandparents, grandparents-in-law, spouse and siblings. This also means that to optimise the tax benefits, you can only top up your parents’ CPF RA to $8000 or $4000 per parent a year or $666.67 a month or $333.33 per parent a month. If you intend to give more than this amount as an allowance to your parents, topping up more would not reap you additional tax relief, though your parents would still benefit from the higher returns from the CPF LIFE payouts. Additionally, if your parents meet the requirements for Matched Retirement Savings Scheme, they will receive an additional top-up from the government, of up to $600, to match the amount you put into through RSTU. Read Also: Retirement Sum Topping-Up Scheme (RSTU) VS CPF Voluntary Contributions: What’s The Difference? Giving Your Parents An Allowance Is A Form Of Immediate Support While Topping Up Their CPF RA Is A Form Of Long-Term Support While there are many benefits to topping up your parent’s CPF RA, it may not be applicable for everyone. For parents who require immediate monetary support, giving an allowance is the most direct method. Likewise, for parents who have little to no CPF savings in their RA, topping their RA may not make sense as the payout increase is very little and spread throughout their lifetime. In these cases, giving your parents the monthly allowance would ease their immediate financial needs and concerns. If your parents are much younger than 65 years old, while the eventual CPF LIFE payout may be much higher, they would not see nor receive the monies until much later in life. Depending on how “CPF literate” they are, it may not be easy to convince them of the benefits of topping up their CPF RA instead of just giving them an allowance. While topping up your parents’ CPF RA may be beneficial in the long run, it does take a long time to collect its full benefits. A top-up of $6000 will take 16 years to pay out via CPF LIFE, even if it yields 6% to 7%. Topping up only works if your parents have no immediate need of the monies and are willing and able to see the long-term benefits: higher risk-free returns on guaranteed capital. Finally, there is a limit to how much you can top up your parents’ CPF RA. Assuming that your parents are above 55 years old, the maximum top-up to their RA is up to the maximum of the Enhanced Retirement Sum which is currently $271,500.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING How We Can Use Retirement Insurance Products To Supplement Our Retirement Income And Retire Early It pays to start retirement planning early by This article was written in collaboration with Great Eastern. All views expressed in this article are the independent opinion of DollarsAndSense.sg based on our research. DollarsAndSense.sg is not liable for any financial losses that may arise from any transactions and readers are encouraged to do their own due diligence. You can view our full editorial policy here. In The State of Retirement in Singapore survey conducted by Great Eastern earlier this year, it was shared that among retirees in Singapore who did not plan for their retirement and depended on a monthly retirement income of $1,200, they barely met their basic monthly expenses. On average, they were only left with about $30 at the end of each month. In the same survey, it was also shared that about 45% of retirees regretted not planning ahead for their retirement, while 60% regretted how they had planned their retirement on hindsight. For those who had planned for their retirement, it came as no surprise that they were generally doing better during the golden years of their lives. Retirees who started planning before the age of 50 had about $625 extra each month to spend on unplanned expenses. The result here is pretty clear. If we want to be in a better financial position during our retirement, we need to be planning for it as early as possible. CPF LIFE Provides A Basic Income While Payout Commences Only From Age 65 When it comes to retirement planning in Singapore, the first thing that comes to our mind is CPF LIFE. CPF LIFE is Singapore’s retirement scheme which serves as the foundation of Singaporeans’ retirement planning that provides lifelong payouts to Singaporeans and Permanent Residents from age 65. Monthly payouts are based on how much individuals have set aside as CPF LIFE premiums, as well as the plan he/she chooses. If there is a need for more, there are other retirement insurance products available to consider layering on. One limitation of CPF LIFE is that payout can only commence from age 65 onwards. This means that for anyone who is planning towards an early retirement (say age 56), CPF LIFE won’t be able to provide us with the monthly payouts we need. However, you still have the option to tap on withdrawable Ordinary and Special Account savings* if you wish to fund some of your expenses for an early retirement. Furthermore, CPF LIFE payouts are capped at the Enhanced Retirement Sum (ERS), which is $279,000† as of 2021 and revised each year. If we set aside this amount at age 55, we will receive a monthly lifelong payout of $2,080 to $2,230 from age 65 onwards. You can have the option to top up the difference in your Retirement Account and ERS whenever the latter is revised such that your CPF Life payouts can increase accordingly. Retirement Insurance Products Allow Us To Start Receiving Retirement Income Earlier For those looking to receive retirement income at an earlier age, we can plan towards an early retirement by purchasing a retirement insurance product such as the GREAT Retire Income. Offered by Great Eastern, this is a participating endowment plan that provides us with a cash payout plus a potential cash bonus every month from our selected retirement age. As policyholders, we can decide on the premium term, retirement age, and how long we want to receive our payouts. What’s more, we are protected against Death, Total & Permanent Disability‡ and Terminal Illness. For example, a 35-year-old male who purchases the GREAT Retire Income plan can choose a five-year premium term with an annual premium of $4,800. In total, the premium paid over 5 years would be $24,000. To support his early retirement at age 56, he can choose a 10-year payout period which gives him a monthly payout of about $471.87§ from age 56 onwards till 66. After that, the individual can rely on his CPF LIFE payouts for retirement income. One misconception to avoid when entering the retirement phase of our lives is to assume that our options are limited to 1) an early retirement where we leave the workplace entirely or to 2) continue working in our full-time job for as long as we can. This isn’t true. There is also a middle ground that we can (and should) consider – working reduced hours. This option is, in fact, one that I frequently observed among some of the older people around me. For example, my mom transited from working full-time to a part-time role for a couple of years before leaving the workforce altogether. She did that because while she needed more time to help out with family matters, our family wasn’t financially prepared yet for her to stop working entirely. Some other people that I know who are not keen on the daily grind of a full-time job have likewise opted for part-time work. Doing so gives them the time they need to pursue what they want, without forgoing an income completely. For those who prefer to enter retirement in a phased approach, instead of going from a full-time job to becoming fully-retired immediately, the GREAT Retire Income plan can provide us with additional income to supplement our salaries when we work reduced hours. Retirement Insurance Products Can Increase Our Retirement Income And Allow Us To Enjoy A More Comfortable Retirement Besides an early retirement, the GREAT Retire Income plan also help us increase our retirement income. Even if we have already set aside the Enhanced Retirement Sum, which gives us $2,080 to $2,230 each month from age 65 onwards, we can also supplement our retirement income with the GREAT Retire Income plan. A 35-year-old male who purchases the GREAT Retire Income plan can choose a five year premium term with a monthly premium of $400ǁ. In total, he pays $24,000 over five years. From age 66 onwards, he chooses to receive a monthly retirement income over the next 20 years. This gives him a monthly payout of about $438.38¶ from age 66 onwards until he reaches the age of 86. For the GREAT Retire Income plan, we can choose between a payout period of 10 or 20 years. Furthermore, the plan also provides additional income for disability if we can’t perform two or more of the six Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) during the payout period. If we prefer the payout period to be lifelong, we can opt for the GREAT Lifetime Payout, a retirement income plan that provides us with a lifetime monthly payout starting from the 4th policy anniversary for as long as we live. Regardless of whether we are working towards an early retirement, or choosing to increase the payout that we can receive during retirement, retirement insurance products such as the GREAT Retire Income and the GREAT Lifetime Payout are options to complement our CPF LIFE payouts, rather than to replace it. The key strength of these products lies in their flexibility and how the products can be designed to suit various types of retirement plans.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg LIFESTYLE 5 Ways You Can Use The Pulse App To Better Manage Your Finances Take a pulse on your finances by This article was written in collaboration with Prudential. All views expressed in this article are the independent opinion of DollarsAndSense.sg based on our research. DollarsAndSense.sg is not liable for any financial losses that may arise from any transactions and readers are encouraged to do their own due diligence. You can view our full editorial policy here. Planning your finances for your life goals, while necessary, can be daunting. Depending on which stage of life you’re in, your personal goals and aspirations will be different. Also, because many of us own and use more than one bank account, credit card and investment account, it can also become difficult to keep track of our finances and understand our financial situation. However, having a financial game plan with goals, sooner rather than later, is crucial especially if we want to achieve our dreams of retiring comfortably, and perhaps even, retiring early. While there are a wealth of apps designed to keep track of our daily expenses and budgeting, few actually help us to think through our financial planning goals. A recent addition to the Pulse app, Wealth@Pulse, provides solutions to make the financial journey simpler, letting users get started on planning their finances at different stages of their lives. Here are 5 ways in which you can use Wealth@Pulse feature in the Pulse app to help better manage your finances, no matter where you are in life. #1 Round the Clock Financial Support Our financial matters can be a personal subject and some of us may have questions about finances that we may not be comfortable with asking or sharing with others. Perhaps, you may be a young graduate with a few years of experience under your belt and may be looking at making your money work harder for you by investing. Or, now that you are earning a stable income, you plan to take on greater responsibility and contribute more back to the family. For young couples with children, you could be thinking of your children’s education and need help figuring out how much to set aside. Regardless of where you are in life, Wealth@Pulse can support you through Ruby, your personal AI Digital Assistant. Simply tell Ruby how you want to start your financial journey and she can then support you with personalised suggestions based on your needs, goals and aspirations. When you tap on Ruby, you’ll see 3 topics:  Say you’ve just started working and you want to save for a house. The app takes you through a guided process, asking you questions on how much savings you currently have, and how much you should target saving each month to hit your goal. You can play around with the different options to get a realistic sense of how much you need to budget and save so that you’re on track to achieve your various goals. #2 Track Your Financial Goals  It pays to think ahead. For those beginning their careers, setting financial goals is crucial as it can help ensure you have sufficient savings and grow your wealth to protect yourself and your loved ones for a better peace of mind. This Goal Setting feature can help you set and track your financial goals and provide personalised planning suggestions for you based on the information that you provide.  Let’s say you have a 3-year-old child, and you want to save for his university education. University fees don’t come cheap and by the time your child turns 18, the fees will be higher than what it is today. For example, we assume a three-year course costs about $40,000. You can input the figure to find out how much you need to save each month to hit that amount. In this case, it’s $224.26/month as the most achievable amount for you to save for the duration of 134 months. The app also gives you options for easy and challenging target amounts. By the time your child turns 18 in 2036, you would have already saved enough to cater for this expense if you are able to fulfill the monthly savings amount. #3 Bird’s Eye View of Your Overall Financial Health  One of the reasons why financial planning is perceived to be complex is because there are quite a few things to keep track of. For Prudential customers, the 360 View dashboard gives you an overall view of all your Prudential insurance plans across protection and savings and investments so that you can easily see what you have already covered and what aspects there may be a gap in and make plans to cover your needs accordingly. This comes in especially useful for young working adults who are just getting started on their financial planning and may be inundated with all the different types of financial products that they have to keep track of. If you do not yet have an investment plan, you can consider getting started with a policy and thereafter, track and manage your investment plans with Prudential. Families can also benefit from this nifty feature and start planning for their children’s coverage and savings needs and to manage all of it on the app. This way, you have a holistic overview of the different areas of your life through the app. For those who are preparing to enjoy a well-deserved retirement, the dashboard’s overview of your existing policies allows you to keep track of and stay on top of your desired financial goals. #4 Improve Your Financial Knowledge  Knowledge is power, the old adage goes. This is especially so when it comes to financial planning. Yet, a lot of this crucial information is difficult to read and understand, and sometimes dry and boring to read. Thankfully, you can find an abundance of financial education resources about a wide variety of topics from savings and investments to spending wisely under Wealth@Pulse.  For beginners, you can find topics such as investing basics to help you get started on building your investment portfolio. For young parents, there are also topics for parents such as how to teach your kids to manage their money, including a Money Parenting Guide and even Cha-Ching, a financial literacy programme designed for 7- to 12-year-olds. For more seasoned investors, there are also topics on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) investing should you wish to find out more. With a variety of topics for beginners to parents, Wealth@Pulse’s financial knowledge resources can provide you with a wealth of information at your fingertips. #5 Make Use of the Budgeting Tool One new useful feature within Wealth@Pulse is the budgeting tool. It allows you to track your expenses to manage your spending across a variety of categories including Utilities and Mobile expenses, Groceries, Shopping, Entertainment and more.  Based on your monthly spending, you can set a budget target based on how much you spend in each category. As you input your actual spending, the app shows you how much of your budget you have left. You can also input your recurring transactions for each month such as mobile phone, utilities, insurance payments, etc. This way, you get to keep an eye on where your money goes each month and stay on top of your spending so that you don’t exceed your budget. Financial Planning Made Simple and Convenient Financial planning can seem daunting and difficult for some to start the journey. Yet, it is an important and necessary undertaking, no matter what stage of life you’re in. Wealth@Pulse makes planning your finances that much simpler. It can help you get started by taking small steps towards planning for life’s milestones, identifying gaps in your financial planning and providing you with helpful suggestions based on your goals and preferences. And of course, remember that you don’t need to undertake this journey alone. Just hit the Call Me Back button on the app and leave your number for one of Prudential’s trusted Financial Consultants to get in touch with you for an in-depth conversation on your financial planning. Keen to get started? You can find Wealth@Pulse on the Pulse by Prudential app. Download the Pulse app today.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg RETIREMENT PLANNING Review Of Autumn App – Worth Downloading If You’re Planning To Seek Financial Independence, Retire Early The Autumn mobile app will help you figure out if you can achieve your Financial Independence and Retire Early (FIRE) dream. by This article contains affiliate links. DollarsAndSense may receive a share of the revenue from your sign-ups. You can refer to our editorial policy here. In pursuit of our financial goals, we will often have different investments bought or held on various platforms. This can make it tricky and tedious to track and measure the performance of our overall portfolio. Solving this problem, is the Autumn app, a mobile application that is available both on Android and iOS platforms. Autumn is an incubated venture by SC Ventures and is a subsidiary of Standard Chartered; therefore, it adopts the same bank-level security measures to protect the private information of users. Simple Sign Up Process For The Autumn App Signing up is a simple process and can be done either by allowing Autumn access to our information via SingPass or manually submitting our inputs. The whole signing-up process via SingPass takes less than 5 minutes to complete. Users can also activate the biometric feature offered in the app to log in to the app more seamlessly after the initial sign-up. Tracking Both Finances And Health  The Overview category is the first page we see on the app and collates all the essential information and sections of the app. The Finance category (one of the icons tabs at the bottom) is currently the most feature-filled section of the app. The other category, Health is still under development but is expected to provide insights to the user’s health score in future. Autumn will also bring in other lifestyle partners to enhance the users’ experience under the health category. In-Depth Finance Tracking Features Autumn shines as a one-stop app by presenting users a single dashboard that consolidates their total net worth across multiple platforms, asset classes and regions. Under the Finance category, there are 4 “cards” or sub-categories to complete:  Savings And Loans Autumn provides two options for users to input their bank account details. The first option is to automatically connect and sync the bank accounts, which requires the user to have an internet banking account. The other option is to manually input the details. The app also provides a few categories under savings and loans that allows the user to aggregate the financial data from the different bank accounts. The process is rather straightforward and allows the user to input the details for the past 6 months. At the end, the app calculates the user’s total net worth after deducting for any outstanding loans and also gives a monthly aggregated view of the total savings versus the total outstanding loan. This function is particularly useful for users who may have multiple savings accounts and loans with different financial institutions and currencies. With this app, users will have a consolidated view, without having to constantly log into the different bank websites to view their latest balances. However, users will need to update their savings and loan balances as part of the weekly update exercise, if the information was initially filled manually or the user can also choose to do an automatic sync.  CPF Savings The CPF Savings card requires the user to simply update their CPF balances to get a consolidated view within the app. It also provides a projection of the compounded balance when the user turns 65 years old, based on the current balance and assuming the monthly contribution remains the same. From this useful feature, the user can then decide whether to top up their CPF funds to achieve their intended retirement sum by age 65. Though CPF’s website has a comparable function, having this function embedded within the app enables the user to see how their CPF funds play a role in relation to their entire net worth. The point of the app is to enable users to get an overview of their finances without having to constantly log into different accounts.  Investments Autumn divides its investment cards into 5 sub-categories, namely: Recording the details for the equity holdings is rather simple, as the app uses Bloomberg tickers and supports stocks from 14 exchanges, including the commonly invested regions of Singapore, Malaysia, United States and Hong Kong. Users may face a slight inconvenience if they are unfamiliar with the Bloomberg tickers for their equity positions as it may sometimes differ from the other more commonly used stock platforms. However, it can be easily overcome by doing a quick check on the search engines. The Autumn app also has a huge database of corporate bonds that the user may hold in their portfolio. Though, the list may not be completely exhaustive as we found out when we tried to input a bond transaction OHLSP 6.9% 08July2024 Corp (SGD) – a bond issued by Singapore-listed Oxley Holdings. Nevertheless we were able to find the other two remaining bond offerings from the same issuer and also bonds from other popular issuers. However, Autumn does not provide inputs for the Singapore Savings Bond (SSB) currently. This is one area they may add in future as SSBs are a popular choice amongst Singaporeans to park their reserve cash given its low-risk and ease of purchase. Users are also able to input their investments in unit trusts or other structured products into the app. Once the user has recorded all of their investment details into the app, the user is presented with a pie chart depicting the asset allocation according to the various asset classes and is further grouped within regions and sectors. This gives a simple and quick overview of how the investments are allocated, which would otherwise could have been easily overlooked. Moreover, having a better visual depiction of the regional and sector-based risks that the user is now carrying allows for a better understanding of our asset allocation.  Properties The app also adds the values of properties to the overall calculation of the user’s net worth or financial health. Users simply have to key in their property address, estimated valuation and if there’s any outstanding mortgage loan attached to the property. The app then geo-tags the property and adjusts the user’s net worth based on the property value and outstanding loan, if any. The app also offers to refinance the mortgage loan, which is helpful to users who are on a higher mortgage rate plan.  Other Useful Features Available On Autumn Retirement Plan Once the user completes all the Finance cards, the app then prompts the user to start building a retirement plan, which is one of the main highlights of this app. Users can now simply use this app to build their retirement plan by inputting their intended retirement age and their desired monthly income to live on. Thereafter, the app factors in the user’s current monthly income and offsets their monthly expenses, as well as accounts for the user’s current assets to build a retirement plan. The user is then presented with a retirement graph that first provides a target retirement goal and then identifies how close (or far) the user is, to achieve it. This gives the user a target to strive for, and with the app doing the heavy lifting of tracking the performance of the user’s investments and net worth, it makes it easy for the user to calibrate their financial decisions in a more informed manner.   Aspiring To A Better Lifestyle We all aspire to achieve certain goals like purchasing a private condominium or buying a new car or even taking a month-long Europe tour. Autumn allows users to record up to 5 of such aspirations so that they can focus and work towards these goals. Having these goals recorded makes one conscientious and prepared to make the necessary spending when the time comes as opposed to spending on them without any prior planning, which can cause a setback to one’s retirement goals.  Insurance The app allows the user to consolidate all of our insurance policies from various insurers. Once completed, the user is presented with a pie chart showing the total annual premiums payable and the allocation based on the different policy types. This is a very useful feature as most people may not know how much they are paying in premiums on an annual basis or know exactly whether they under or overinsured in a single policy type. But with this app, it is easier to have a better understanding of the user’s insurance coverage. The app also provides a timely and convenient monthly reminder on the outstanding premium due on any of the policies. This will come in handy for those who are making direct payments and also track the outflows for that month.  The Autumn App In a world where data privacy is not a privilege but a right, it is important for users to be assured that the developers behind this app are trustworthy as it deals with sensitive personal information. As a subsidiary of Standard Chartered, Autumn adopts similar bank-level security measures to safeguard and protect the financial and health information of its users. As an independent and holistic retirement planning platform, Autumn not only allows for easy integration of our financial data to derive our consolidated net worth, but it also offers recommendations that are not limited to an existing pool of exclusive partners, but instead uses an open marketplace. Moreover, the services offered on the Autumn platform are customer-centric as it personalises its recommendations based on the user’s specific goals, aspirations and values from the data provided by the user. In a sea of finance-related mobile applications, Autumn stands out as a must-have application for every individual looking to keep close tabs on their overall financial well-being and net worth by helping to track our investments and provide guidance to achieve our financial goals.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING 4 Retirement Trends We Can Observe From The OCBC Financial Wellness Index 2021 More are opting for simple retirement lifestyle, but it may still be too expensive. by Amidst the global pandemic, Singaporeans are paying more attention to financial management and are improving their financial health. This can be seen in the 2021 results from the OCBC Financial Wellness Index where our overall score improved to 62, up from 61 in 2020. The OCBC Financial Wellness Index is a survey that aims to understand Singaporean’s state of financial health based on 10 pillars of financial wellness as defined by OCBC’s wealth management experts. The 10 pillars are: 1) savings habits, 2) spending beyond means, 3) manageable debts, 4) protection from financial emergencies, 5) regular reviews, 6) regular investing, 7) retirement planning, 8) excessive speculation, 9) borrowing money, and 10) gambling habit. The Index results showed that Singaporeans are scoring better in retirement, improving by 5 points to 49 from 2020’s score of 44. Although retirement planning scored the third lowest on the overall scoreboard, it scored one of the strongest improvements amongst the 10 pillars. This suggests that while retirement planning has taken a backseat to more immediate priorities (such as having enough financial cushion to sustain for 6 months if jobless, having enough funds to overcome a crisis or being able to spend comfortably), people are paying more attention to retirement planning. Here are 4 interesting trends we observe about Singaporeans’ mindset towards retirement from the OCBC Financial Wellness Index results. Read Also: DollarsAndSense Took The OCBC Financial Wellness Index Survey – Here’s How Well We Scored And What We Learnt #1 More Are Planning For Retirement The uncertainties that the pandemic has caused are motivating more Singaporeans to plan for their silver years with 51% listing retirement planning as one of their top priorities. This is a 6% increment compared to 2020 where only 45% were planning for retirement. More women (52%, a 5% increase from 2020) and men (50%, a 7% increase from 2020) have also indicated planning for retirement as one of their top 3 priorities. More respondents have started making retirement plans, 66% in 2021 compared to 63% in 2020. While we tend to associate retirement planning with the older age groups, the younger generations are also planning for retirement. 58% of those in their 20s and 67% of those in their 30s have started making retirement plans, showing the largest increase (7%) from last year. In fact, 33% of those in their 20s and 41% of those in their 30s report as being on track with their retirement plans. On the other end of the age spectrum, 57% of those aged between 40 to 54 and 62% of those aged 55 to 65 report as being on track with their retirement plans. This suggests that there is a minority of those nearing retirement who are still unprepared for retirement. #2 More Are Opting For Simpler Retirement Lifestyles Another interesting observation is the change in preference for retirement lifestyles. In the survey, participants were asked to select their preferred retirement lifestyle. Amongst the surveyed Singaporeans, those who picked the simplest lifestyle made up the biggest group (40%) with 35% selecting lifestyle B, and 25% lifestyle C. This is a 4% overall increase in those who picked lifestyle A. Preference towards lifestyle A is more prominent as we grow older, with 59% of those aged 55 to 65 choosing this option, a 10% increase from last year. This suggests that Singaporeans – regardless of maturity – are becoming more sensible and prudent after being hit with the realities of the pandemic.  Source: OCBC Financial Wellness Index #3 We Underestimate Our Retirement Needs By Almost One-Third On Average While retirement planning is back on Singaporeans’ radar, it is still a neglected area in their financial portfolio. According to OCBC’s survey findings, 81% of respondents are underestimating the amount needed for their chosen retirement lifestyle, compared to 78% in 2020. On average, they are underestimating their retirement needs by 31% (a slight improvement over 32% in 2020).  Source: OCBC Financial Wellness Index Based on the findings, the younger the age group, the higher the tendency to underestimate their retirements needs. The youngest age group (20s), being the newest and freshest to join the workforce, underestimated their retirement funds by an average of 46% of the required amount for the lifestyle they’d chosen. Those who are older tend to make more accurate retirement estimates, with the eldest age group (55-65), only underestimating their retirement funds by 23%, which might speak to their experience. However, at their age, they’re also nearing the minimum retirement age of 62 years old (or 63 years old come 2022). This underestimation is worrisome as they have a shorter runway to work with to generate enough income to set aside savings for their retirement. For them, making up a shortfall of 23% can range from anywhere between $541.65 to $1,224.75 per month, based on the 3 lifestyle scenarios mentioned above. Read also: Is A Retirement Income Of $2,000 A Month Realistic For An Average Singaporean? #4 Regular Contribution And Investing Is The Key To Having Enough For Retirement Most Singaporeans are good at saving, which is the best scoring of the 10 financial pillars. 88% of respondents are setting aside at least 10% of their salary and saving regularly. However, even though more of us are better prepared for rainy days, it still may not be enough. Singaporeans who have started making retirement plans tend to accumulate retirements funds through cash savings (55%), local stocks (39%), endowment (39%), regular investment plan (38%), CPF LIFE (32%) and foreign stocks (25%).

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING 1M48A… “A” for “Alone” 1 million at the age of 48 alone by Today is my 49th birthday. Yesterday, I crossed S$1,000,000 mark in my CPF monies (not including the CPF used for my house).  I termed this milestone of achieving S$1M at 48 years old with my CPF “1M48A” with a little emphasis on “A” for “Alone” and not combined with my spouse.  I would like to share the steps that I have taken to reach 1M48A, in the hope that many more Singaporeans will become millionaires and multi-millionaires in Singapore. In my early days of sharing the 1M65 strategy in 2015, I was heavily criticized that the 1M65 strategy was designed for a couple to each achieve S$500k at 65 years old.  At that juncture, I deliberately set the bar low, so that more Singaporeans will be inspired working toward 1M65, considering that many Singaporeans cannot even meet the Full Retirement Sum of S$186k upon retirement. Read Also: 1 Million at 65 Using CPF? Here’s The Math Behind The 1M65 Concept However, I had pushed myself hard to outdo my own strategy. Internally, I set my mind to cross S$1M before 50 years old on my own individual account. It was very tall order! The best way to achieve it is to start early by topping up my CPF in my early 20s. However, I started the 1M65 journey much later when I was about 30 years old, only after I met my mentor and learnt about this “kungfu”.  Many did not believe that it is even possible. This is how I achieved 1M48 alone: I Maxed Out My Special Account (SA) And Medisave (MA) In My Early 30s This is a no-brainer: the SA and MA have a 4% interest rate that compounds powerfully over 30 years. Every S$1 put into a 4% instrument compounds into S$3.24 in 30 years.  So by living frugally and diligently transferring my OA to SA and not touching my MA, I was able to meet the CPF Full Retirement Sum in my early 30s.  After close to 20 years, the CPF has compounded powerfully and contributed to the bulk of my 1M48A CPF net worth. This will continue to snowball into a multi-million dollar CPF retirement fund when I cross 65years old.

I Did Not Indulge In A Private House And Stayed In A HDB All These Years I know it is many Singaporeans’ aspiration to own a condominium or landed house. Private housing has a halo effect in Singapore in terms of aesthetics, comfort and social status. More importantly, given our land constraints, property in Singapore could appreciate. In fact, we are currently experiencing a property bull run, caused by the pandemic. However, owning a private property comes at a huge opportunity cost of depriving your CPF of the ability to compound significantly. Most private property owners also have to leverage their housing purchase with huge property loans, which increases stress levels in times of job insecurity and reduces your job mobility. By not owning private property, I allowed my CPF balances to compound powerfully to reach a significant 1M48A. Read Also: Are Condos Really A Good Investment & Are Private Properties A Sign Of Riches In Singapore? I Worked Two Jobs And It Doubled My CPF Contribution! This strategy involves two lesser-known CPF policies, that I used to my advantage: First: The only way you can contribute over the Full Retirement Sum of S$186K in your Special Account is to through your earned salary. Second: The salary ceiling for CPF contribution of $6,000 per month is on a per job basis.  This means that if you have 2 jobs earning $6,000 each, you will be able to contribute 2x 37% x $6,000 = $4,440 into your CPF every month! Since I work in two jobs that earned above S$6,000 monthly, I am able to double my CPF contribution, when compared to another worker who earns S$12000 monthly. Yes, it is not easy to get your employer to allow you to take on an extra job.  Many companies would not allow it in the past.  However, in this post-pandemic economy, taking on an extra job has become more acceptable, as most of us are working from home. Additionally, taking on an extra part-time job could provide extra job security.

These funds compound very healthily (usually annualized returns of 8-12% across a long period of time), despite the occasional volatility.  Coupled with my gutsy strategy of buying heavily during market crashes, I have reaped reasonably good returns from the S&P500.  This has boosted my CPF position.

The CPF MA reaps a return of 4% annually – one of the highest amongst risk-free assets.  Thus, it is to our advantage not to utilise our Medisave for any medical expenditure where possible especially when we are young.  Whenever a medical expenditure arises, my preferred mode of payment would always be cash. This way I can maximise the compounding interest on my MA, even if it means having to be more frugal to replenish my cash savings depleted by medical expenses.

The recent stock market correction has set back my 1M48 attempt by a little.  Nevertheless, just before my birthday hour, I made a transfer under the Voluntary Housing Refund (VHR) scheme to return S$25,000 into my CPF OA. The VHR scheme allows CPF members to return cash back into their CPF to make up for the amount of CPF that was withdrawn for housing payments, including accrued interest. More Singaporeans should take advantage of this scheme as they near the age of 55, as they could easily withdraw it anytime after 55 years old. Moreover, they would earn at least a 2.5% interest, beating any fixed deposit rates available in the market now. So for me, this is akin to making a fixed deposit of S$25K for 7 years, earning 2.5% interest annually. Quite attractive huh?

One must take deliberate efforts to accumulate the CPF funds as much and as early as possible.  Besides maxing out our SA and MA, one could explore higher returns that give decent market returns like the S&P500 or equivalent investment products that CPF Board allows under the CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS).  In the 1M65 Telegram community, I am seeing more and more CPF millionaires and multi-millionaires emerging – a very encouraging phenomenon.  I urge all Singaporeans and residents in Singapore to make good use of your CPF to build your wealth.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING How To Develop Higher Income Stream for Our Retirement When planning for our retirement, it’s important to develop multiple income streams by This article was written in collaboration with Fullerton Fund Management. All views expressed in this article are the independent opinion of DollarsAndSense.sg based on our research. DollarsAndSense.sg is not liable for any financial losses that may arise from any transactions and readers are encouraged to do their own due diligence. You can view our full editorial policy here. In Singapore, retirement planning is an unavoidable part of our financial plans. As our country’s social policy is based on self-reliance and we do not provide universal benefits to retirees, we have the responsibility to plan for our retirement during our younger, working years. In a Fullerton Fund Management report titled – Rethinking Retirement, it was revealed that on average, only about 69% of respondents have started retirement planning, with younger people less likely to have started. Singaporeans also estimated that they need $1.4 million to retire comfortably. Unfortunately, only about 38% are confident of achieving their desired retirement income.  So what are some of the common income sources that Singaporeans are looking at to fund their retirement lifestyle? According to Fullerton’s findings, the top five (in the following order) are: CPF, investment returns, savings, endowment/insurance plan and property rental. Pros and Cons of Retirement Income Solutions Planning for a healthy retirement is a bit like planning for a healthy meal. It doesn’t have to be complicated, but at the top level, you need a balanced diet of different foods (i.e. vegetables, protein, grains and fruits) to keep you healthy by providing the nutrients you need. With retirement planning, each of the popular income solutions can play a role, but they also come with their own set of limitations. #1 CPF LIFE For a start, CPF LIFE can be an excellent building block in every retirement plan. CPF returns are pre-determined and stable, while CPF LIFE provides regular lifetime payouts that are guaranteed. For a guaranteed scheme, CPF’s regular interests of between 2.5%-4% p.a. are fairly attractive. It is however designed to provide a basic income level only. As of 2021, if you can set aside the maximum of $279,000, which is the CPF Enhanced Retirement Sum, in your Retirement Account at age 55, it will provide about $2,080 – $2,230 a month from age 65. Those who prefer an increasing payout (by 2% p.a.) can opt for the CPF LIFE Escalating plan, where payouts will start at about $1,760 a month at 65. It’s not shabby, but for many, it probably still won’t be enough for their retirement lifestyle. The recent Minimum Income Standards 2021 report by the NUS LKYSPP and NTU found that an elderly person in Singapore currently needs $1,421 monthly for basic living expenses alone. Read Also: Minimum Income Standard (MIS) Of $6,424 For Singapore Families? 5 Things To Understand About The “Basic Cost Of Living” Figures Reported Also, monthly payouts only start at age 65 which means you can’t rely on the income for early retirement. Moreover, not everyone will have $279,000 in their CPF to set aside at age 55 (especially since many members use their CPF for housing). #2 Financial Assets Coming in a close second is Investing in Financial Assets such as stocks, bonds, ETFs and REITs. Some of these financial assets can offer good, dividend income while others may provide us with long-term capital appreciation. Investing in financial assets can be richly rewarding, help you beat inflation and stretch your savings longer, but investors have to be ready to stomach price volatility and invest over a longer period. Moreover, if you wish to invest in these assets on your own, you will not only need the knowledge to make the right investment decisions but also the time and energy to actively manage your own portfolios. Alternatively, you could invest in a diversified investment fund such as a unit trust, which makes this step relatively simpler.  #3 Savings & Fixed Deposits While many consider Saving and Fixed Deposits fairly safe in Singapore’s context, returns are miniscule (as low as 0.05% p.a.). The purchasing power on your life savings can get diluted very quickly by an inflation running at 1.5% p.a. over the past 20 years. Since your savings won’t grow by much, this also means that the money, once withdrawn, won’t be able to grow back quickly. Deposits however serve its purpose as an emergency fund: During rainy days you can simply stroll to an ATM and make an immediate withdrawal. But in the overall scheme of things, relying on savings alone is probably the worst way to manage your retirement finances as withdrawals and inflation will quickly eat into your savings jar.  A typical Singaporean’s retirement planning framework #4 Annuity & Endowment Plans There is a myriad of commercial options with Annuity and Endowment Plans. Besides obtaining regular payouts (some portion of it guaranteed, some only for a limited number of years), many have insurance components built into the plans. Long-term returns are typically not mind-blowing (some dependent on the performance of an underlying investment plan), but many have a minimum value and provides a safety net should you fall sick or be retrenched. #5 Property Rental Another popular retirement income strategy is to buy into an Investment Property for Rental. Typically, this means retirees own two properties, one to live in and the other that is rented out for passive income. However, owning a rental property usually requires some form of involvement and a large upfront financial commitment from property owners. As a landlord, you can’t afford to have a hands-off approach. This may not be ideal for retirees, in particular if they want a stress-free retirement that does not require them to constantly worry about finding tenants and upkeeping their properties. Supplementing Your Retirement Nest Egg Via Investments Rather than trying to figure out which asset classes can give us a higher yield for our retirement, one way to invest is to do so through a diversified, professionally managed investment fund to achieve a sustainable total return at a moderate level of risk. Rather than focusing only on the dividend yield or coupon payments of asset classes, we should be more interested in a portfolio’s total return, including dividend returns and capital appreciation, not just one without the other. Doing so will allow us to ensure that we can get sustainable distribution income from the total return of the portfolio.  For more information, go to: www.fullertonfund.com/trmi One such income-oriented fund for retail investors in Singapore to consider is the Fullerton Total Return Multi-Asset Income. The fund aims to generate regular income and long-term capital growth in SGD by investing in a portfolio of global growth stocks, Asian bonds, cash and other permissible instruments such as gold and commodities. By investing in a combination of asset classes, the fund can realise returns from both income and capital growth, as opposed to just one without the other. The total return generated by the fund can then be used to provide distribution income* for investors, with a distribution option that offers fixed monthly payouts of 6.88% p.a. Another interesting feature is that during periods of market opportunities or stress, the portfolio manager has broad latitude to adjust the fund’s risk exposure through hedging or adjusting the cash and asset levels to increase upside potential or limit downside risks. This ability to retreat to and from safe assets provides more leeway to safeguard a portfolio’s asset value and enhance returns. Different Share Classes for Investors with Varied Requirements One point that is worth noting is that even within the same investment fund, investors may sometimes have different objectives on what they hope to achieve from the fund. For example, younger investors who are just starting out in their retirement planning journey may not require dividend payouts and may prefer to reinvest their dividends to enjoy compound return and capital growth for the long-term. Those with families may want their investments to give them additional passive income. For retirees who rely on dividend income to sustain their lifestyle, a fixed and higher level of regular income will be vital. In this aspect, the Fullerton Total Return Multi-Asset Income also provides three options, also known as share classes, for investors to choose from. Class A: An accumulating share class in which all dividends are reinvested for higher potential capital growth; suitable for young working adults seeking asset growth over a longer time horizon; Class B: A distributing share class that seeks to build accretive returns and provides investors with a moderate dividend monthly payout so that investors with family commitments may have an extra income stream; or Class C: A distributing share class that distributes portfolio gains and capital growth in the form of dividends at a fixed monthly payout of 6.88% per annum. This allows investors to receive a higher regular income that supplements their existing government or private retirement schemes in their retirement years. Read Also: BRS, FRS, ERS: Why There Are 3 CPF Retirement Sums & Why They Increase Every Year One thing we like about such investment funds is that they provide greater flexibility in terms of deciding when we want our payouts to start and choose their preferred payout level, as opposed to CPF LIFE that follows government policies strictly when it comes to commencing payouts. Another distinct difference between CPF and investment funds, such as the Fullerton Total Return Multi-Asset Income, is that such investment funds can earn us a higher return. The fund invests in equities that are growth-focused, as opposed to safe-haven assets like government bonds. This is, particularly crucial, during a low-interest-rate environment where yields are at record-low levels. The tradeoff here is that returns from investment funds are not guaranteed. That is why it’s also important for us, as investors, to buy into a diversified fund that invests in different asset classes, and think long-term as investing over a longer-term horizon will allow us to ride out the market volatility. If you are thinking of starting your investment journey now, our advice is to stop procrastinating and get started today. Whether it’s through investment funds, starting your self-directed portfolio, or just topping up your CPF savings, it always pays to start early. * The fund declares distribution out of income as much as possible but retains the discretion to distribute out of capital as deemed appropriate. 4 STOCKS THIS WEEK Singtel (Z74); StarHub (CC3); NetLink (CJLU): Local Telcos Dividend Yield And Share Price Performance BRANDED CONTENT Cashback Vs Miles: How To Enjoy The Best Of Both Worlds MONEY Complete Guide To Multi-Currency Accounts And Wallets In Singapore [YouTrip, Revolut, Wise, DBS My Account, UOB Mighty FX And More] INSIGHTS 7 International Rankings That Singaporeans Enjoy PROPERTY En Bloc Deal: 3 Ways You Can Still Not Make Any Money COLUMNS 8 Things You Need To Know Before Heading To The Money Changer BRANDED CONTENT Why Homeowners Should Avoid Overspending on Their HDB Flats MONEY 11 Joints Savings Account To Open With Your Spouse Or Parents BONDS AND FIXED INCOME Step By Step Guide To Buying T-Bills Online Using Your CPF OA Savings ESTATE GUIDE Neighbourhood Estate Guide: Rediscovering Jurong East, The Regional Centre Of The West                     Copyright © 2019 DollarsAndSense. \n",

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING Is A Retirement Income Of $2,000 A Month Realistic For An Average Singaporean? Our co-founder Timothy shares why his ideal retirement – and how much he would need for it – will differ significantly from how much his parents need. by This article was written in collaboration with CPF. All views expressed in this article are the independent opinion of DollarsAndSense.sg based on our research. DollarsAndSense.sg is not liable for any financial losses that may arise from any transactions and readers are encouraged to do their own due diligence. You can view our full editorial policy here. How do you feel about having $2,000 a month as your retirement income? The answer to that question very much depends on your intended purpose during retirement. For some of us, $2,000 a month is more than enough for retirement. For others, this amount may be hard to get by. It all depends on what we want to pursue during our retirement. If, like me, you are a working parent today – with young children to care for – you may balk at the thought of having to survive on just $2,000 a month, considering your potential financial commitments, including providing for their education, paying home mortgage and other necessary expenses such as insurance and investment needs. So How Much Do You Need To Retire In Singapore? Here is a piece of good news. When we retire, there is a good chance that many of the expenses that we currently incur during our working years will no longer need to be paid. For example, by the time we retire, our home mortgage should already be cleared off. If we have children, we could safely expect them to have completed their education and started working instead of being reliant on our income. Our insurance and investment needs will also be largely reduced by then. In fact, according to the latest report on the Household Expenditure Survey 2017/2018, the average monthly household expenditure per member among households comprising solely of non-working persons aged 65 years and over is $1,154 per month, with the average household expenditure among retiree households at $1,967.  Source: Singstats As someone with two retiree parents, I can relate to how our retirement expenditure can vary according to the intended purposes we have during retirement. Both my parents have always been frugal, and this eventually became a good habit they brought to their retirement. Whenever they are not preparing meals at home, they will buy food from coffee shops or hawker centres. Drinks hardly cost more than $2 and individual meals usually do not exceed $10 except when they are eating out with friends at nicer places, or if their grandchildren (my kids) tricked them into going to Swensen’s for ice-cream. For my parents, one of their main purposes during retirement is striving to keep themselves physically and socially active. They spend a good part of their day exercising at the park, catching up with their retiree friends through leisure activities, and helping to look after their six grandchildren. These are activities that they enjoy doing which don’t cost much, if any at all. Perhaps, the only exception is when they pamper their grandchildren with little treats. However, they do have a unique consideration to factor into their retirement expenses because my family has a member with special needs – my sister – and another important purpose during their retirement is to continue caring for her. While my parents don’t require a domestic helper at the moment, it’s an expense that they will eventually need to spend on when they are older and no longer able to care for my sister on their own. Hence, even in their golden years, they still make it a point to continue living below their means so that they can set aside enough money to care for my sister, especially when they are no longer around. Knowing my frugal parents, I estimate that they currently spend about $3,000 a month and this includes the expenses for my special-needs sister who lives with them. Based on a per household member basis, this works out to be about $1,000 a month, slightly below the amount that the average retiree in Singapore spends each month. However, if they engage a domestic helper in the future, average expenses will increase to about $4,000 a month. Read Also: How Much Does It Cost To Hire A Maid In Singapore? If you were to ask me to retire today, my wife and I would struggle to get by with what my parents are spending for their retirement, even if we do not have to worry about the living expenses of my special-needs sister and our grown-up children. Unlike my parents who can live rather frugally, my wife and I desire a retirement with other purposes that will likely cost more. For example, we tend to spend more on food and drinks as we dine out at restaurants. Like my parents, we strive to keep fit but we do it at a private gym (about $100 per person), as opposed to the park which is free. We enjoy watching the latest shows but that requires subscription to video streaming services like Netflix and Disney+. Travelling is also on our to-do list and places like New Zealand and Japan is surely going to cost more than an island-hopping tour in Singapore that my parents will sometimes go for. During our retirement, my wife and I would also want to stay involved in the entrepreneurship and financial literacy scene. And if I were to decide to invest in private businesses, a higher level of savings will be required. Hypothetically, if my wife and I were to retire today with no home mortgage or young children to care for, a conservative estimate of what we need would be about $4,500 ($2,250 per person). Even then, this wouldn’t be sufficient if we want to travel regularly to further places. It certainly wouldn’t be enough if I want to invest in private businesses. How CPF LIFE Can Support Our Retirement In Singapore, CPF LIFE is a national longevity insurance annuity scheme that provides Singapore citizens and PRs with monthly, lifelong payouts from age 65. We have the flexibility to choose among three CPF LIFE plans (Escalating Plan, Standard Plan and Basic Plan), and to make that decision, we should consider the retirement lifestyle and amount of monthly payouts we wish to have during retirement.    Monthly lifelong payout from CPF LIFE from age 65 based on the Standard Plan * These monthly payouts are estimates based on the CPF LIFE Standard Plan, for those who are age 55 as of 2021. Payouts may be adjusted to account for long-term changes in interest rates or life expectancy. For retirees such as my parents, the CPF Full Retirement Sum (FRS), which gives them about $1,430 to $1,530 each month*, will be sufficient to achieve their retirement purposes of keeping physically and socially active and continuing to care for my special-needs sister. However, for me and my wife, I doubt the amount would be sufficient. While it may be enough to cover basic provisions that we will need during our retirement, we will surely need more if we want to pursue our retirement purposes as mentioned earlier. Under the CPF Enhanced Retirement Sum, if we can set aside the $279,000 (as of 2021) at age 55 in our CPF Retirement Account, we will be able to receive about $2,080 – $2,230 each month* from age 65 onwards. This would be close to what someone like me would need for my retirement – though I would probably still want to supplement it with additional income from my stocks, REITs and bonds portfolio. To be clear, this is based on the hypothetical situation of my wife and I retiring today (assuming we are 65, which we are not!), for the purpose of comparison with my parents. Of course, when we choose to retire years from now, I would expect the retirement income we need to be higher due to long-term inflation and future increases in the standard of living. This is also why it’s important for the Retirement Sums to be adjusted upwards every year. Your Purpose During Retirement Will Determine How Much You Need As shared above, even within the same family, you can see the differences between what my parents want for their retirement, and what my ideal retirement purposes would be. These differences also determine how much we need. Socialising with your friends and heading to the park or the library don’t cost much, if anything at all. Travelling overseas with your spouse and fellow retiree friends and keeping fit in a private gym is going to cost a lot more. And if I want to continue investing in private businesses or contribute to society in other ways, then I will need a much larger nest egg. What Is Your Purpose During Retirement, And How Are You Planning To Achieve It? In collaboration with the CPF Board, you can participate in our #AskMeAnything (AMA) by asking any questions you have on retirement, or even your own retirement purpose, and how CPF can play a part. Leave your questions on the IG post on the DollarsAndSense Instagram page, and stay tuned to the CPF Instagram Page where your questions will be answered by Minister for Manpower Dr. Tan See Leng in a panel discussion video. Update on 22 December: The CPD discussion video is out! Watch Minister for Manpower Dr. Tan See Leng, Xenia Tan, Jai Kishan and Chris, as they discuss retirement-related purposes that they have for themselves.  4 STOCKS THIS WEEK Singtel (Z74); StarHub (CC3); NetLink (CJLU): Local Telcos Dividend Yield And Share Price Performance BRANDED CONTENT Cashback Vs Miles: How To Enjoy The Best Of Both Worlds MONEY Complete Guide To Multi-Currency Accounts And Wallets In Singapore [YouTrip, Revolut, Wise, DBS My Account, UOB Mighty FX And More] INSIGHTS 7 International Rankings That Singaporeans Enjoy PROPERTY En Bloc Deal: 3 Ways You Can Still Not Make Any Money COLUMNS 8 Things You Need To Know Before Heading To The Money Changer BRANDED CONTENT Why Homeowners Should Avoid Overspending on Their HDB Flats MONEY 11 Joints Savings Account To Open With Your Spouse Or Parents BONDS AND FIXED INCOME Step By Step Guide To Buying T-Bills Online Using Your CPF OA Savings ESTATE GUIDE Neighbourhood Estate Guide: Rediscovering Jurong East, The Regional Centre Of The West                     Copyright © 2019 DollarsAndSense. \n",

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING Are The Rich Getting Richer During The Pandemic? 3 Lessons We Can Learn From The Wealthy And Become Wealthier Too The number of millionaires in Singapore increased by 5.5% in 2020. by The COVID-19 pandemic has been tough on everyone. Whether you are a frontliner, essential worker, or office worker adjusting to work-from-home, everyone has their own struggles with the changes the pandemic has forced upon us. Yet, if your gut sense is telling you that these struggles are not equal, you are also not wrong. The pandemic has struck our society unequally and emphasised some rifts in society including the divide between the wealthy and the not-so-wealthy. According to Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report 2021, the percentage of millionaires (above US$1 million) in Singapore has increased from 3.1% in 2015 to 5.5% in 2020. The number of millionaires in Singapore was around 270,000 in 2020 and is expected to increase to 437,000 in 2025. Read Also: [2020 Edition] The Richest In Singapore And How They Made Their Fortunes Globally, USD 28.7 trillion was added to global household wealth during 2020, an increase of 7.4% while wealth per adult rose 6.0% to a new record high of USD 79,952. Adjusting for exchange rate changes (i.e. the depreciation of the US dollar), total wealth would have risen by 4.1% and wealth per adult by 2.7%. This is while GDP growth stalled or even become negative for most countries. In Singapore, the economy contracted 5.4% in 2020 but total household wealth increased by 9.4% and wealth per adult increased 8.3%. With such incongruous statistics, you may be wondering how and where this wealth increase is coming from. Instead of dwelling on whether fate has dealt us a poorer hand, here are 3 things that we can learn from the wealthy (and help us get there too). #1 The Wealthy Own Stocks Invest, invest, invest. This is the number one advice in personal finance that is repeated to the point that people start tuning it out like mum’s nagging. Yet, there is a good reason why investing in financial assets such as stocks is important. Financial assets, including stocks, bonds and other securities, accounted for most of the gain in total wealth in 2020. In Singapore, financial assets form about 58.5% of gross wealth. If you have invested in US stocks (which make up more than 50% of the global stock market), you would have likely benefited from the 19.6% increase in the US share price index in 2020. In fact, financial wealth per adult increased 8.1% in Singapore in 2020. Read Also: Why Do Many Singaporeans Perform Poorly Investing In The Stock Market? #2 The Wealthy Own Property Aside from financial assets, the wealthy also own real assets (e.g. property and land). Possibly Singaporeans’ favourite investment, property and other non-financial assets form about 41.5% of gross wealth in Singapore. As the pandemic caused people to stay at home for the most part of 2020, the unplanned savings from travel and other consumption as well as the increased desire for more space when working from home resulted in an increased demand for housing. Almost every homeowner in Singapore would have experienced an increase in wealth as Singapore’s house price index rose by 1.1% in 2020. In fact, both HDB resale prices and private property prices have continued their rise into 2021. In total, non-financial wealth (including property and land) per adult increased 5.4% in Singapore in 2020.

The ratio of debt to assets was 14.8% in 2000, but fell to 14.2% in 2007 and declined further to 13.0% by 2020. In Singapore, the household debt dipped 1% in 2020. However, not all debt is bad or detrimental to our wealth. The pandemic also caused governments to intervene in major ways to support households through the economic contraction. One of the key measures was quantitative easing to increase money supply and encourage lending and investment. This contributed to an even lower interest rate environment, compared to the pre-pandemic period. This low interest rate environment contributed to the rise of share prices and also made it easier and cheaper to finance or refinance loans to acquire real assets. Unsurprisingly, many homebuyers in Singapore took advantage of home loans that were hovering around or below the 1% p.a. interest rate to finance or refinance their mortgages.

Wealth Is Accumulated Over Time As many people who are somewhat familiar with personal finance or investing will know, the above three ways are nothing new. In fact, they have been repeated so often that it is either taken for granted that everyone knows them, or it is dismissed because if it is so simple to get rich, why aren’t more people rich? The truth is that wealth is accumulated over time. Investments take time to compound over time and property takes time before you can own and acquire them and you still need to maintain them while hoping that they appreciate with time. Debts need to be used judiciously and appropriately. All these actions take time, knowledge and effort to understand. So start applying them today and eventually you too will accumulate wealth.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INSURANCE How Much Do I Need To Retire In Singapore And How Do I Build My Retirement Income Stream? The average safe retirement income floor for most retirees would be somewhere between $700 to $1,500 per month. by This article was contributed to us by MoneyOwl. If you have ever tried to figure out how much you need to have to retire in Singapore, you’ve most likely been confounded by one of the most basic yet most difficult question to answer – how much monthly income do you need during your retirement? This requires one to imagine what life is going to be like when we stop working – will we be globe-trotters, happy-go-lucky shoppers, active-agers or home-bounders? Couple that with inflation rates and years in retirement (how long you expect to live till), it is no wonder many give up trying to figure it all out. We have some surveys that can help to shed some light: To find out what made the differences among the three estimates, let’s compare across the broad categories of goods and services. As per the table below, the categories that saw the largest variance are clothing and footwear, transport, recreation & culture, and others (which include holiday expenses). Understandably, to lead a more meaningful retirement, focus group participants in the LKYSPP study agreed that more money would be needed to support participation in social and recreational activities.  However, when we compare how much a single retiree in the upper-middle household (which represents the 60 – 80th percentile of our retirees) spent in retirement, about $1,150 per month, I can’t help but wonder if there is indeed a gulf between expectations and reality. It appears that while there are aspirations to socialise and participate in recreational activities, most retirees end up spending more on telecommunications (why travel when I have the world at my fingertips?) and on healthcare, underscoring the fact that while Singaporeans are living longer, they are not necessarily living healthily. Multiple Layers Of Retirement Income Amidst the complexities surrounding how much one needs for retirement income, it is probably useful to create multiple streams of income to address different needs in retirement much like a kueh lapis. Each layer of income has features to cater to your expenditure patterns in retirement and correspondingly will be supported by suitable financial instruments in the market. Unlike an accumulator, a retiree faces a complex set of risks. As the retiree no longer has an income flow, it is crucial to guard against excessive spending in the early years of retirement that could lead to savings depleting prematurely especially as we are living longer. With retirement stretching over a 20 to the 30-year period, simply leaving assets in the bank will not do as wealth is being eroded by inflation, hence there is a need to invest to keep pace with inflation. However, this comes with investing risk as the retiree will need to deal with the ups and downs of the market. Lastly, as one grows older, poor health may cause retirement funds to be depleted even faster. A simple yet effective design of future income stream to address all these issues would be made up of three parts – i) the safe retirement income floor to cater for your basic living expenses, ii) a secondary layer of income to cater for more lifestyle-related expenses, and iii) a third layer of income that covers your caregiving expenses in the event of severe disability.  An example of a retirement income stream structure Layer 1 –  Safe Retirement Income Floor From Your CPF Nest Egg And Retirement Income Insurance Plans The first layer of retirement income is for your basic expenses. This would refer to how much you minimally need for basic food, transport, utilities and healthcare. In planning, this would be called the safe retirement income floor and forms the base of your retirement income. As this is meant to sustain the day to day living in your retirement, this layer of income needs to be regular, stable and last for life. A lifelong income stream guards you from outliving your savings. Referring to the surveys above, the average safe retirement income floor for most retirees would be somewhere between $700 to $1,500 per month today. Now if this number sounds familiar to you, it should. It is how much payout CPF LIFE would provide for someone who has set aside a retirement sum between the Basic and Full Retirement Sum. Given that CPF LIFE provides a stream of stable lifelong income, it is the perfect candidate to form any retiree’s safe retirement income floor. However, should you choose to retire before your CPF LIFE payouts start, your source of safe retirement income floor would be different. For example, retiring before 55 years old would mean most of your income would come from your cash or near-cash instruments like Singapore Savings Bonds or fixed deposits. A post-55 retirement would mean being able to withdraw excess CPF savings in the Ordinary and Special Account after setting aside your retirement sum in the Retirement Account. Apart from the above, payouts from retirement income insurance plans can also form part of the safe retirement income floor. These instruments provide some guarantees in either capital, returns or payouts thus providing the certainty suitable for a safe retirement income floor. Layer 2 – Additional Income For Lifestyle-Related Expenses From Investible Assets   The second layer would be made up of income from investments. Although not many people can afford investment properties for rental income, it is possible for many of us to save and invest regularly through a disciplined investment plan that will help us grow a second nest egg which we can draw on for additional income during retirement while protecting our wealth from being eroded by inflation. The most important source of your retirement funds will come from your income, specifically your monthly cash surplus (i.e., savings after deducting expenses from monthly income). This means having the discipline of keeping to a budget or paying yourself first every month. If you have never budgeted or have no clue how much you can save, a quick rule of thumb would be at least 15% of your monthly salary plus 50% of your annual bonus. What’s more, if you have been working for some time, you would have also accumulated some investible assets which could be sitting in your bank, low interest fixed deposits, endowment policies, bonds, shares, unit trusts, investment property(ies) and not forgetting your CPF accounts. All these form part of your investible assets which can be deployed for your retirement planning after setting aside resources for your children’s education, if any, and emergency funds (3 to 6 months in cash is recommended). With the knowledge of your current financial situation, it is now a matter of using a reasonable rate of return to project how much these current assets and surplus would accumulate to by the time you reach your desired retirement age. But that’s not the end of the story. The gap in retirement planning in Singapore today is that it is still largely catered to the demands of wealth accumulators. These solutions while suitable for building wealth leaves little ideas on how a retiree can decumulate their wealth to get a sustainable and reliable income stream when they finally decide to stop working. While investments are an efficient way of providing an additional stream of income, investing in retirement is subject to a sequence of returns risk. Drawing too much income from your portfolio when the market is down could deplete your nest egg quickly; whereas for accumulators who do not draw down their portfolio, whether the market goes up or down in their investing journey does not matter, as long as overall the market goes up over their entire time horizon. We, therefore, need to have a sensible withdrawal rule or invest in a solution that is specially designed to give us an income stream in a simple fuss-free manner. With this in place, the investment component will provide the flexibility and growth needed to boost your income according to your lifestyle requirements. Layer 3 – Contingency Income For Caregiving Expenses If Severely Disabled The third layer of “contingency” income will come in handy if you need caregiving in your old age. While we hope that our golden years will be smooth sailing, statistics from the Ministry of Health tell us that 1 in 2 healthy Singaporeans aged 65 today are expected to be severely disabled in their lifetime. What this means is that there is a 50% chance that what you need for your retirement income could be even more to pay for caregiving expenses, such as for a family member to stay home to look after you; a trained domestic helper or long-term stay in a home-nursing facility. These costs could add up to more than $3,000 per month depending on the level of care required. Because severe disability may not affect all of us, this third layer of income would be most efficiently addressed through national insurance schemes like ElderShield/CareShield Life and its accompanying supplements. Such plans provide a monthly income benefit if you are unable to perform more than 2/3 out of 6 Activities of Daily Living (i.e. eating, bathing, toileting, dressing, transferring and moving around). Since October 2020, CareShield Life was rolled out to gradually replace ElderShield to provide a higher payout of $600 per month for life. The payout will also increase by 2% per year until the policyholder reaches 67 years old or makes his/her first claim. Singaporeans and Permanent Residents born 1980 or later were auto-enrolled into CareShield Life in 2020 or will be when they turn 30 years old from henceforth. For those born between 1970 and 1979, CareShield Life will be extended to you sometime end of 2021. If you are concerned that there are still gaps in this area, you can also enhance the benefits through supplements offered by private insurers. The premiums of these plans can be paid through your MediSave, up to $600 per year. Besides, some retirement income insurance plans have also built-in such benefits into their income payout to help mitigate the healthcare risk faced by retirees.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING 4 Factors You Should Consider When Buying A Retirement Insurance Plan In Singapore In case you don’t think CPF LIFE is sufficient for you. by This article was written in collaboration with Etiqa. All views expressed in this article are the independent opinion of DollarsAndSense.sg based on our research. DollarsAndSense.sg is not liable for any financial losses that may arise from any transactions and readers are encouraged to do their own due diligence. You can view our full editorial policy here. Retirement in Singapore is often associated with hitting the milestones of reaching age 65 and receiving our CPF LIFE payouts. However, as some of us may already know, CPF LIFE may not always be sufficient for all. This is because payouts under CPF LIFE are based on how much we contribute to our CPF account, which is in turn limited by the Full Retirement Sum and Enhanced Retirement Sum. For those below 55, we can only make voluntary contribution up to the Full Retirement Sum. For those age 55 and below, we can make voluntary contribution up to the Enhanced Retirement Sum. For example, if we are 55 in 2021 and have set aside the Enhanced Retirement Sum ($279,000 as of 2021) in our CPF Retirement Account, we will get about $2,080 to $2,230 each month via CPF LIFE payouts from age 65 onwards. This is good, but depending on our lifestyle preferences, there may still be a gap between our ideal future retirement expenses, and the maximum amount we can receive each month from CPF LIFE. One of the ways we can bridge this gap and assure ourselves of a more comfortable retirement is by purchasing a retirement insurance plan. Unlike CPF LIFE, there is no contribution limit for retirement insurance plans. If we want to pursue a more comfortable (or even luxurious) retirement, we can choose a retirement plan that pays out a higher retirement income each month. Of course, this means the premiums we pay will be higher. Read Also: Why Retiring Well In Singapore Goes Beyond Financial Planning For those of us who want a steady stream of income in our retirement as well as insurance protection, a retirement insurance plan can be a great addition to our retirement planning. However, with different plans available on the market, choosing the right plan is not always simple. Here are 4 factors we should consider when choosing a retirement insurance plan. #1 Payouts That We Receive Is Based On The Premiums We Pay The first thing that most of us will think about when it comes to buying a retirement insurance plan is how much we will get. There are three main factors that will determine the payout that we will get. The first is the premiums that we pay. If our premiums are higher, then correspondingly, our payouts will be higher. The second factor is the premium term. The longer our premium term duration, the more we will be paying. Lastly, the accumulation period will allow our nest egg to compound so the longer it is, the more we should expect to have. For retirement insurance plans, there is typically a guaranteed and non-guaranteed component for the monthly payouts. For those who want a higher guaranteed income, you should expect to pay higher premiums to achieve the desired payouts. Regardless of the underlying fund performance, the insurer will have to pay out the guaranteed component of promised payouts. If the fund performs poorly, the insurer may pay out less for the non-guaranteed component. The proportion of guaranteed and non-guaranteed payouts would be spelt out in the benefits illustration. #2 Check If There Is An Increment Factor To Account For Inflation While our parents’ generation could have bought a plate of chicken rice for 50 cents, you won’t be surprised to pay $5 for that same plate of chicken rice today. If we intend to retire in 30 years, we shouldn’t expect to pay $5 for a similar plate of Chicken rice in the future. This means if we are planning for our retirement today, we would need to account for the increased cost of living in the future, even if our lifestyles remain the same. Not all retirement insurance plans available on the market today account for inflation. This means that we would need to make our own calculations as to the retirement income we desire in today’s dollars, and then add in our own increment factor to account for inflation so that we can maintain our desired lifestyles in future dollars. If this sounds complicated, you may wish to consider a plan that includes an in-built inflation increment factor. An example of a retirement insurance plan that offers an inflation increment factor is Etiqa’s new Enrich retirement plan. This plan offers a choice to opt for payouts that increase at 2% p.a. to account for inflation. Considering that MAS Core Inflation measure has risen 36.7% in the past 20 years (or about 1.8% a year averaged out), Etiqa’s Enrich retirement plan has a realistic increment factor of 2% p.a. to counter inflation. #3 Flexibility In Choosing Our Premium Terms & Retirement Payout Options Another advantage of retirement insurance plans is the flexibility in premium and payout terms. If we don’t fancy retiring at 65 years old, we can design your retirement insurance plan such that you can commence the monthly payouts earlier. For example, Etiqa’s Enrich retirement plan allows us to commence payout at age 60. We can also choose between a retirement payout period of 10 or 20 years. Of course, if we want to start our payout earlier, or have a longer payout period, this means our monthly payout will be lower. If we wish to increase our payout level, we would either have to pay higher premiums, opt for a longer premium payment period, or purchase our retirement insurance plan at a younger age. For retirement insurance plan, our premiums (minus the distributions costs) are essentially invested on our behalf by the insurer and the amount is compounded during the accumulation period. The longer the accumulation period, the more time our premiums have to grow to our desired returns. #4 Insurance Protection For Our Retirement One key differentiation of retirement insurance plans from passive income investing is the insurance protection that these plans offer (aside from the guaranteed income component). Our retirement years are usually also the time when we start to be more concerned about the legacy we leave behind for our loved ones as well as concerns over our own health as we age. In addition to providing us the financial security of a retirement income, retirement insurance plans also provides us with the peace of mind that our loved ones are adequately provided for in the event of our passing. Additionally, some retirement insurance plans also provide additional coverage for illnesses that tend to strike us in our old age.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING Why Retiring Well In Singapore Goes Beyond Financial Planning Retiring well in Singapore isn’t just about having enough money. We also want to be physically healthy and mentally able. by This article was written in collaboration with Etiqa. All views expressed in this article are the independent opinion of DollarsAndSense.sg based on our research. DollarsAndSense.sg is not liable for any financial losses that may arise from any transactions and readers are encouraged to do their own due diligence. You can view our full editorial policy here. When we think about retirement planning in Singapore, we typically see it as solely a financial matter. This makes sense. Whether it’s retiring at age 65 when we start receiving our CPF LIFE payouts or enjoying early retirement in our 50s, we need to accumulate enough savings to retire well in Singapore. According to a 2016 Singstats report, a household led by someone who is above age 60 will spend an average of $3,586 per month. If we assume a household size of two, this works out to be about $1,793 a month for each person. This amount exceeds the CPF LIFE payout that we are eligible to receive at age 65, which ranges between $1,430 – $1,530, if we set aside the Full Retirement Sum at age 55 ($186,000 as of 2021). There is also an option for us to set aside the Enhanced Retirement Sum ($279,000 as of 2021) if we want higher monthly payouts of about $2,080 – $2,230 per month from age 65. If you feel that the CPF LIFE payouts are far from sufficient for retirement, you are not alone. According to a retirement survey* done by Etiqa Insurance Pte. Ltd. in collaboration with YouGov, only 3 in 10 Singaporeans believe that their CPF LIFE payouts are sufficient to cover potential medical and healthcare-related bills. On the same note, only 3 in 10 Singaporeans believe that they can sustain their ideal lifestyle after retirement with just their CPF LIFE payouts. This isn’t a definite statement to say that CPF LIFE payouts are not enough. The simple fact is that CPF LIFE payouts are sized such that they are sufficient to provide us with a basic lifelong income for retirement. However, many of us may desire a more comfortable lifestyle after retirement that goes beyond basic provisions. For example, we want to pursue our hobbies (which can be expensive), spend time with the people we love, and have the freedom to experience the life we want during our golden years. Retiring Well Isn’t Only About Having Sufficient Passive Income Each Month There is a tendency to think that retiring well is only about having sufficient passive income each month. This isn’t true. In the Etiqa retirement survey done in collaboration with YouGov, 96% of respondents believe that being physically and emotionally healthy is among the topmost important factors for their retirement. This is sensible, because no amount of money is ever enough if we lack good health (in both physical and mental aspects) to enjoy our retirement.  Results based on a 2020 YouGov survey commissioned by Etiqa When we think about being physically healthy in our old age, we think of enjoying life without the burden of critical or chronic illnesses. More often than not, the state of our physical health as we age is a cumulative result of how we lived in our younger days. Like how we are now preparing ourselves financially for the future, we also need to start adopting a healthy lifestyle today in order to enjoy peak physical health during our retirement. And if we are fortunate to enjoy good health after retirement, we need to keep up with our health by staying active, eating right and going for regular check-ups. Similarly, our emotional and mental well-being are areas that we cannot afford to ignore. Maintaining positive relationships with our family members and friends in our younger days is vital. Many of these relationships will stay with us. If we struggle to retain good relationships with the people around us in our younger days, we may face similar challenges as we age. Introducing Amber, A Retirement Ecosystem Platform That Aims To Help Singaporeans Have A Holistic Retirement To help Singaporeans have a holistic retirement, Etiqa has launched Amber, a platform designed to connect Singaporeans to a range of valuable services that may come in handy after retirement.  Amber retirement ecosystem focuses not only on financial health, but also physical and mental health With Amber, members can access healthcare and medical services such as telemedicine, nursing, caregiving, dental and physiotherapy. This is helpful to not only retirees who may require these services, but also for those of us who are looking after the needs of our elderly parents, and would like to engage external help.  With Amber, we can connect to healthcare partners that provide a wide range of services Beyond the essential services, Amber connects members to interesting recreational activities. Members can search to participate in health and wellness classes such as yoga and nature walks, arts and crafts workshops and also dementia care workshops. By providing easy access to these activities, Amber hopes to help its members to explore new interests and to expand their social network.  Amber also curate activities that are suitable for retirees to participate in As part of Etiqa’s launch special, the first 150 customers who sign up as an Amber member will receive $100 worth of Amber dollars to redeem up to 3 Amber Retirement Ecosystem services or activities, and an additional $50 Etiqa e-wallet credit for purchase of any Etiqa’s retirement plan within 12 months.

Enjoying Our Retirement Requires Good Health, Relationship & Finance To enjoy our retirement, we need to put ourselves in the best possible position financially, physically and emotionally. With easy access to healthcare providers and lifestyle activities via platforms like Amber, we are one step closer towards improving our overall well-being and having a fulfilling retirement.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING CPF LIFE Standard, Basic Or Escalating Plan. Which CPF LIFE Plans Should You Choose? It’s all about your life expectancy. by Most developed countries in the world have their own version of a pension scheme. This is to ensure that retirees continue to receive a basic level of income support in their old age when they are no longer working. While some countries have welfare schemes to provide for this income, Singapore uses the CPF Lifelong Income For The Elderly (CPF LIFE). CPF LIFE is an annuity plan that provides Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents (PRs) with a monthly payout from age 65, for as long as they live. Payouts from CPF LIFE are based on how much individuals have in their Retirement Account (RA). The more you have in your RA, the higher you can expect your monthly payout to be. That said, how much you receive from CPF LIFE is also based on some other factors. To increase CPF LIFE monthly payout, CPF members can choose to defer the start of their payout. For each year that they defer after reaching 65, they can increase their monthly payout by about 7%. For example, a monthly payout of $750 to $800 at age 65 will increase to $990 to $1,070 by age 70. The other factor that determines how much you receive each month is the CPF LIFE plans that you select. Today, there are three CPF LIFE plans that members can choose from. They are the Standard Plan, Basic Plan & Escalating Plan. Read Also: Is The CPF LIFE Scheme Really That Bad? We Explore What’s The Difference Between The CPF LIFE Standard Plan & Basic Plan? A simple way of understanding the three CPF LIFE plans is to look at how CPF illustrates the differences. The infographics below is extracted from the CPF website.  Source: CPF The CPF LIFE Standard Plan, which is the default plan, provides a higher level of monthly payouts while leaving a lower bequest. The CPF Life Basic Plan gives a lower monthly payout but leaves a higher bequest. Do note that the payout under the Basic Plan will get progressively lower when your combined CPF balances eventually fall below $60,000. This is because the extra interest is earned on the first $60,000 of your combined CPF balances are credited to the Retirement Account (RA) and paid as part of your monthly payouts. As balances fall due to payouts, the extra interest earned and subsequent payouts will also decline as well. The CPF LIFE Escalating Plan provides payouts that increase by 2% each year so that CPF members can generally maintain their standard of living even as prices rise over the years. Under the Escalating Plan, a monthly payout that starts at $1,000 when a CPF member is 65 would reach approximately $1,500 by the time the person is 85. Read Also: CPF LIFE Escalating Plan: What You Need To Understand About The Latest CPF LIFE Plan Before Opting For It One way to choose between the three CPF LIFE plans is to ask yourself whether you 1) prefer to have a higher monthly payout, 2) whether you prefer taking less each month, in order to leave a larger legacy for your loved ones or 3) rather accept a lower starting payout with an increment of 2% in payout each year to maintain your purchasing power in the presence of inflation. However, this method of choosing between the three CPF LIFE plans can be a little simplistic, at least in our opinion. We believe Singaporeans can make a more informed decision if they analyse and understand the three plans better. The Benefit Illustration Think of the three CPF LIFE plans as separate annuity products that you are considering. For the calculation below, we assume that an individual has set aside the Full Retirement Sum of $186,000 (as of 2021) in their Retirement Account at age 55, and starts their CPF LIFE withdrawal at age 65.  Source: CPF LIFE payout estimator CPF LIFE Standard Plan At age 55, you set aside the Full Retirement Sum of $186,000 (as of 2021) in your Retirement Account. From age 65 onwards, you will receive $1,478 to $1,635 each month. If you pass on at 75, your bequest will be $94,945 to $98,724. If you pass on at 81 or later, there will be no bequest. Age Member Passes On 75 $271,783 – $296,559 85 $356,198 – $394,035 $533,558 – $590,235 The simple logic here is that the longer you live, the more you gain financially from CPF LIFE. This makes sense since there is a commitment to pay CPF members a monthly payout as long as they live. CPF LIFE Basic Plan At age 55, you set aside the Full Retirement Sum of $186,000 (as of 2021) in your Retirement Account. From age 65 onwards, you will receive $1,345 to $1,491 each month. If you pass on at 75, your bequest will be $201,311 to $213,184. If you pass on at 92 or later, there will be no bequest. Age Member Passes On Total Amount Received 75 85 $419,830 – $460,126 $484,534 – $537,282 Once again, the longer you live, the better off you will be. If you compare strictly using the total payout amount received and do not take into consideration the time value of money (i.e. a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow), the Basic Plan provides a higher total payout as compared to the Standard Plan for someone who passes on at age 75 and 85 because of the much higher bequest received. However, if you are fortunate to live till 95 or later, the Standard Plan becomes superior compared to the Basic Plan since you enjoy a higher payout monthly amount each month, while there is no bequest left for either CPF LIFE plan at that age. CPF LIFE Escalating Plan At age 55, you set aside the Full Retirement Sum of $186,000 (as of 2021) in your Retirement Account. From age 65 onwards, you will receive $1,162 to $1,297 each month. This makes the starting payout lower compared to both the Standard Plan and the Basic Plan. If you pass on at 75, your bequest will be $118,697 – $123,406. If you pass on at 82 or later, there will be no bequest. Age Member Passes On 75 $340,656 – $380,192 $568,038 – $633,958 Assuming you live till age 95 and beyond, the CPF LIFE Escalating Plan gives you the highest payout because the annual 2% increment in payout becomes valuable. However, assuming an individual passes on at age 75, the total amount received is lower compared to the other two plans because while their monthly payout is still lower at that age, the bequest they receive is not as high as compared to the CPF Basic Plan. Read Also: Why The New CPF Lifetime Retirement Investment Scheme Could Be A Retirement Gamechanger Life Expectancy Matters On Which CPF LIFE Plans Is Ideal For Us Given that our tables above show that individuals who live a longer life (i.e. 95 and above) should opt for the Standard plan while those who are not as confident of living till their 90s should opt for the Basic plan, the question now turns to which plan should Singaporeans choose from. The life expectancy rate in Singapore is 82.6. However, that’s a life expectancy rate at birth, which while useful, isn’t the most accurate to be based on for our situation. CPF members who are choosing their CPF LIFE plan will be 65 years old. At that age, the average life expectancy for adults is 20.8 years. This also means about 1 in 2 adults who reach age 65 will also reach age 85. You can check this out on the Singstat website. Our Analysis On Which CPF LIFE Plans To Choose From Since about 50% of CPF members who are 65 will reach age 85, the total amount received at age 85 becomes a key number for us to consider. If a member were to pass on at exactly age 85, he and his loved ones will receive more under the CPF Basic plan. Here’s a look once again at the numbers based on meeting the Full Retirement Sum of $186,000 (as of 2021) at age 55. Standard Plan $356,198 – $394,035 Basic Plan $419,830 – $460,126 $340,656 – $380,192 Based on this approach of assuming a person passes on at age 85, the CPF Basic plan appears to be the superior plan as it pays out more in total. Of course, we cannot say for certain that the CPF Basic plan is better. As shown above in the article, if a person were to know that he will live till age 95 or beyond, then the CPF Life Escalating plan or Standard plan will be better, since passing on at age 95 means having no bequest, regardless of which plan they choose from. Thus it would be a better strategy to get as much as possible each month once your CPF LIFE payout commences. By the same token, if a person were to pass on earlier, say at age 75 or before, then the CPF LIFE Basic plan is superior. Of course, there is no way of knowing all these things in advance. As a CPF member who is turning 65, we can consider our existing health circumstances and make the best possible choice on which CPF LIFE plans would be most ideal for us.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg MONEY Why DBS NAV Planner Will Be The Go-To Financial Tool Now That SGFinDex Allows Consumers To Consolidate Their Financial Data DBS NAV Planner can now help you consolidate financial data from other banks and government agencies. by This article was written in collaboration with DBS. All views expressed in this article are the independent opinion of DollarsAndSense.sg based on our research. DollarsAndSense.sg is not liable for any financial losses that may arise from any transactions and readers are encouraged to do their own due diligence. You can view our full editorial policy here. While some of us were focusing on the digital bank license results made earlier in December, another major announcement may have gone unnoticed on 7 December 2020. This was when the launch of the Singapore Financial Data Exchange (SGFinDex) was announced. What Exactly Is The SGFinDex? SGFinDex is a public digital infrastructure that allows individuals to access their financial information held across CPF, HDB, IRAS and 7 participating banks in Singapore. With SGFinDex, we can now use our SingPass to retrieve consolidated personal financial information from CPF, HDB, IRAS and the 7 participating banks in Singapore. For example, we can get information such as our deposits, credit card balances, loans and investments from financial institutions we have a banking relationship with. Likewise, we can also retrieve financial information from CPF, HDB and IRAS. In the initial phase, seven banks will be participating in SGFinDex along with the government agencies. The participating banks are This means that we can retrieve information from these participating banks using our SingPass via SGFinDex. To be clear, these are personal financial information that 1) belongs to us and 2) we already have direct access to. SGFinDex does not give us any new information that we don’t already have. What it does help us to do is to easily access, via applications, the information held by these entities. How SGFinDex Can Help Us With Financial Planning If you ever tried to do financial planning, one of the challenges you will face is having to consolidate all the financial information needed. This involves a tedious process of needing to retrieve data from accounts that are held with different banks and government agencies. Through SGFinDex, we no longer need to manually extract information from different financial institutions and government agencies. Instead, we can retrieve the financial information needed from these entities using our SingPass. For the initial SGFinDex phase, here is the information we can retrieve.  Source For those worried about their privacy, SGFinDex itself does not store any information. It only retrieves and transmits information to the financial planning platforms that we wish to share the information with. This needs to be authorised by us via SingPass. We can also choose to disconnect the access anytime we want. To Use The Information On SGFinDex, We Still Need A Financial Planning Platform Like DBS NAV Planner While SGFinDex is great, by itself, it is not an app and you can only access it through a trusted financial planning platform, like the DBS NAV Planner. It’s only when we have the right financial planning platform that the information can be retrieved. The good news for us is there is a perfectly ideal financial planning platform that we can already use in Singapore – the DBS NAV Planner. For those who don’t know, the DBS NAV Planner is a digital tool that helps us track, protect and grow our money, designed around a comprehensive financial planning framework. For those of us who are an existing DBS/POSB customer with internet banking access, then we already have DBS NAV Planner, whether or not we realised or have used it before. We can access this via the “Plan” tab in DBS ibanking or the DBS digibank mobile app. What is good about DBS NAV Planner is that if we already have a banking relationship with DBS, it can utilise the information it already has from DBS to give us a good picture of our financial situation. This includes our spending and saving patterns each month, investments we have made and insurance protection policies we may have bought through DBS. For example, like most people in Singapore, I use DBS for my day-to-day expenses. The DBS NAV Planner detects how much I spend and save each month, and based on this, can also give me insights such as the emergency savings I currently have. As you can see, at just 2.3 months, the amount of emergency savings I have isn’t looking too good.  But here’s the problem. Like many other people, I have savings in other bank accounts beyond DBS. So while DBS NAV Planner is useful, it doesn’t always give me a complete picture of my financial situation unless I connect it with information from other banks. Prior to SGFinDex, if I wish to have a complete view of my finances using the DBS NAV Planner, I could still get it but that would require me to manually key in the additional information needed such as my savings in other non-DBS accounts. I will also need to continually update the information to ensure that DBS NAV Planner can present to me information that is accurate. However, with the launch of SGFinDex, we can now choose to connect the DBS NAV Planner automatically to any of the other participating banks and government agencies. It’s interesting to note that even if you are not an existing DBS customer, you can still use the DBS NAV Planner by downloading the DBS digibank app.  Based on our experience via mobile, you will need to login via your Singpass twice. The first login is to access SGFinDex, which you can do so using your Singpass. If this is the first time you are using SGFinDex, you will need to add the various banks that want to SGFinDex. The second login is to provide permission for the DBS NAV Planner to access the information on SGFinDex. You can refer to the steps below as explained by DBS.  Once we have done so, our DBS NAV Planner will utilise the additional information from other financial institutions to give us a more accurate assessment of our financial status. For example, I now have a much healthier level of emergency savings at 9.2 months once my savings from other bank accounts are taken into consideration.  Besides information from other financial institutions, DBS NAV Planner can also include information from government agencies such as CPF, HDB and IRAS. DBS NAV Planner Can Provide Us With Insights Beyond Just Financial Data Merely having information isn’t good enough if it doesn’t inspire us to take action to attain positive outcomes. One advantage that DBS NAV Planner has is that after it has a holistic overview of our financial situation, it can provide us with valuable insights that can lead to concrete actions to improve our current financial situation. For example, based on your current assets and liabilities and projected future expenditure and income, the DBS NAV Planner can help you project your future cashflow for your goals or retirement and help you plan 20, 30, or even 40 years ahead. Keep Track of Investments Similarly, the DBS NAV Planner also has an investment feature on its platform that can tell us the value of our portfolio. One of the features includes a real-time investment tracker. For example, once you tell DBS NAV Planner you own 1000 stocks of Apple (AAPL), the value of investments will reflect real-time market conditions. Similarly, if we invested in other asset classes such as unit trusts (whether it’s with DBS or other banks), the market value of these investments would be reflected automatically in our DBS NAV Planner, thanks to SGFinDex. There would no longer be a need for us to manually adjust our investment portfolio value each time we want an update. While SGFinDex does not allow us to link our CDP account (yet), we can still add equities and ETFs that we own to the DBS NAV Planner. Once added, the value of these equities and ETFs will automatically be updated by DBS NAV Planner. For example, as someone who owns some Singtel shares, I can add the assets to my DBS NAV Planner.  The indicative price SGD 2.33 that you see above is automatically provided by the DBS NAV Planner based on the current Singtel share price. Once added, it will be going into your investment portfolio along with other investments that you may have. DBS NAV Planner can show you the market value of your investments.  I also have some Nikko AM Singapore STI ETF shares that were bought through DBS so this is automatically included in my investment portfolio for the DBS NAV Planner. Insurance Coverage Gap The DBS NAV Planner has a protection feature that helps us understand if we have any insurance coverage gap. These include critical illness mortgage insurance, health insurance and life insurance. Once we provide DBS NAV Planner with information on our existing insurance policies, it can suggest to us what are the protection gaps we may have. One challenge that we still need to accommodate (for now) is that we have to manually update insurance policies and certain investment that we may have made beyond DBS. This is because currently, SGFinDex doesn’t allow us to connect insurance and some investment information (like our CDP holdings) in its initial launch phase. However, this could change in the future. With DBS NAV Planner being able to encompass money management, protection, investments and retirement planning, it’s, in our opinion, the most comprehensive financial planning tool available to all for free in Singapore. Despite that, DBS NAV Planner is still relatively beginner friendly. Even if you don’t want to deep dive and geek out about your financial health, it’s still relatively accessible to people just beginning their financial journey. Indeed, DBS NAV Planner is not just about helping us consolidate information – an excel sheet can do that if need be. Instead, the additional value with DBS NAV Planner is that it can provide us with useful insights that we need to help us make better financial decisions. According to DBS, the DBS NAV Planner has already helped more than 1.8 million users to do budgeting and monitor their investment performance, and obtain personalised financial insights and recommendations. 400,000 of them have even turned their finances around through using DBS NAV Planner. And with SGFinDex, the question isn’t so much about whether the DBS NAV Planner can help more people in Singapore, but rather, whether you will be keen to take the first step to start your financial planning journey now that you have the tools in your hand to get started easily.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INSURANCE Living To 100 Or Beyond? 5 Important Financial Areas To Review To Build A Multi-Stage Life If we are living beyond 100, we need to plan towards it financially. by This article was written in collaboration with Prudential. All views expressed in this article are the independent opinion of DollarsAndSense.sg based on our research. DollarsAndSense.sg is not liable for any financial losses that may arise from any transactions and readers are encouraged to do their own due diligence. You can view our full editorial policy here. With one of the highest life expectancy at birth of 84.8 years, it should come as no surprise that the number of centenarians in Singapore has also increased significantly over the past 10 years, from 700 in June 2010 to 1,500 in June 2020. Thanks to advancements in medical technology and healthier living, people in Singapore can expect to live even longer lives in the future. This brings us to an important question: if we are going to live longer lives compared to the generation before us, what can we do with the additional years? Do we use the extra years to volunteer for a cause that we believe in, pursue an interest that we have, or extend the number of years that we would continue working for? And with our additional years in the world, we need to be prepared to build for ourselves a multi-stage life that goes beyond just the traditional three stages – school, work and retirement. This may include further education and retraining as we find ways to stay relevant in our workforce. Options to take a sabbatical before pursuing our next career could also transform the traditional three stages of life that we are used to into a longer, multi-stage life that would look like school, work, sabbatical, school, work, retirement. In theory, this sounds feasible and even logical. In reality, a 2018 research paper commissioned by Prudential showed that more than half of Singaporeans surveyed were not ready to live till 100. So what can we do to prepare ourselves financially for a multi-stage life that could stretch beyond 100 years? #1 Save & Invest A Larger Portion Of Our Income As we embrace a multi-stage life that may include multiple periods of non-work, we need to take proactive steps to ensure that we have enough not just for our retirement, but also when we are not working such as during our sabbatical or when pursuing further education. This means diligently saving a larger proportion of our income during our working years. Besides saving, we also need to invest our savings. This will allow us to grow our retirement nest egg and to ensure that inflation doesn’t erode the spending power of our savings. According to Prudential’s Saving For 100 research, the top three most popular tools that Singaporeans are using are their CPF (79%) , bank savings accounts and fixed deposits (71%) and 66% (life insurance). Which brings us to our next point.  Source: Saving for 100: Saving for longevity in Singapore report by Prudential Singapore #2 Utilising CPF LIFE & Retirement Insurance Plans To Obtain Higher Monthly Payouts As Singaporeans and PRs, we have to make mandatory contributions to our CPF accounts each month when we work.  Source: Prudential Facebook Page Perhaps as a sign that even the Singapore government understands that people need to plan to live beyond 100, CPF LIFE was introduced in 2009 to replace the Retirement Sum Scheme (RSS). The critical difference between CPF LIFE and the RSS is that CPF LIFE provides a lifelong monthly payout for as long as we live while the RSS provides monthly payouts that is expected to last till 95. For those who wish to have a higher lifelong guaranteed income, we can consider topping up our CPF Retirement Account to the Enhanced Retirement Sum, which is $271,500 as of 2020. This will give us a monthly lifelong payout of between $2,030 – $2,180 from 65. Read Also: CPF LIFE VS Retirement Sum Scheme: What’s The Difference? However, depending on the standard of living that you are used to, CPF LIFE may not be enough to provide you with all the income that you need. According to the most recent Household Expenditure Survey 2017/18, the monthly expenses for a non-working person aged 65 and above who is living in a condominium or private apartment is $2,680 per month. In this instance, the individual would need to have additional income to supplement his monthly CPF LIFE payouts. A retirement insurance plan is one tool that we can use to provide us with supplementary income for our retirement. As compared to CPF LIFE, retirement insurance plans are more flexible and can cater to the specific needs of individuals. For example, those who wish to opt for early retirement can use a retirement insurance plan such as the PRUGolden Retirement Premier, which allows us to start payouts from as early as 55. We can choose how long we want the payout period to be. So, if we want to retire at 55 but need a steady stream of income to sustain us till our CPF LIFE payouts commence at 65, we can choose a payout period of 10 years, starting from 55. For those of us who need greater flexibility, we can consider the PRUActive Retirement plan. This plan allows us to customise when our payout period start, from age 50 up to age 110. So whether you want to have an early retirement or intend to work till your later years, the PRUActive Retirement is suitable in supporting the decisions you want to make for your multi-stage life. Read Also: How Much More CPF LIFE Monthly Payouts Would You Receive If You Deferred Till 70 #3 The Remaining Lease On The Home That We Buy Some Singaporean home buyers are attracted to older HDB flats and rightly so. Older flats tend to be 1) located in central locations such as Kallang and Ang Mo Kio 2) are usually more spacious and 3) may be cheaper compared to newer flats in the same area. However, when buying a resale flat, one factor to be mindful of is the remaining lease on the flat. For example, buying a 40-year old flat means having a remaining lease of just 59 years from when we purchase it. For a 30-year-old buyer, this means that the lease will run out when the person is 89. Now that many of us need to be prudent about planning to live beyond 90 or even 100, we should carefully consider the remaining lease on the home we purchase as we would ideally not want to outlive the lease on our home. #4 Consider Insurance Policies That Provide You With Coverage For Life There are two main types of insurance plans – Whole Life Insurance Plans and Term Life Insurance Plans. As their names suggest, a whole life insurance plan provides us with insurance coverage for life, or up till age 100. A term life insurance plan usually provides us with insurance coverage for a specific term, usually up till age 70 or 75. However, some term life insurance plans such as PRUActive Term may allow you to buy coverage till age 100. As we live longer, we may prefer to have insurance coverage to cover us during our later years, or even for the duration of our entire life. For example, we may wish to have a whole life critical illness plan that provides us with a lump sum payout if we are diagnosed with any critical illnesses during our lifetime. This is when a whole life insurance plan will be important. #5 Embrace Learning In Our Multi-Stage Life When it comes to learning, the traditional mindset that we used to have was that people learn in school before joining the workforce to work. In 2020, such a perspective is no longer applicable. Rather, to keep ourselves relevant in our later years, we should regularly upskill ourselves. SkillsFuture is the umbrella movement to support Singaporeans in their journey of lifelong learning and professional development. Among other things, the SkillsFuture framework provides an integrated eco-system of high-quality, relevant, and industry-recognised educational and training programmes, regardless of your age or stage of career. Subsidies are also provided via a variety of credits, grants, and even scholarships available. Read Also: Up To $1,000 In Credits From 1 October 2020: Understanding The Next Bound Of SkillsFuture And How You Can Spend It Beyond just utilising their SkillsFuture credits, many working professionals are also embracing lifelong learning. An example is Darren Ho. One of the founders of local men’s title AUGUSTMAN. Darren took some time off in 2017 to reassess his life and after spending a few months picking up new knowledge in e-commerce while travelling through Western Europe and Asia, Darren returned to Singapore to work for a global content and e-commerce platform. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Darren has switched to a new industry – advertising while concurrently pursuing further studies. You can read up more about Darren’s experience here. As more of us begin on our multi-stage lives, we may find that similar to Darren, our careers and even our children’s careers will not conform to traditional societal norms that we were brought thinking. Career switches, further studies, constant upskilling and even taking a sabbatical during the peak of our careers may become increasing common in the future. We may also find ourselves working beyond the retirement age – not because we have to, but because we want to and are able to. We captured all these considerations in an infographic:  With all these in mind, it is wise to consider having a holistic long-term plan to help us prepare for this longer, multi-stage life. With the additional life span, living a fulfilling long life is possible when we are financially prepared and set realistic goals to realise our dreams that we have always desire.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING Your Retirement Guide: 8 Best Singapore REITs to Buy Now Invest in real estate without buying a property by This article was contributed to us by Willie Keng, CFA, Chief Editor at Dividend Titan. Pandemic or recession, here’s what you exactly need to know about the best Singapore REITs to buy now. In the mid of 2000, Blackstone Group, a major investment firm completed the purchase of one of the largest US office property buyouts at US$37.7 billion. People thought they were crazy. It was then the largest property buyout at the height of a property bubble. Yet the company profited massively from the investment. You see, timing in the market is important. But the “smart money” like Blackstone Group knows what beginner investors lack — They know how to take advantage of properties to grow their assets. In fact, today, Blackstone has grown and managed more than US$540 billion of assets. And much of their success lies in picking good property investments. REITs Still the Most Stable Form of Leveraged Investing for Dividend Income If you’re an income investor in retirement or growing your wealth for retirement, you want to think like a Blackstone. At its heart, a REIT is an asset class full of value. And it’s a wonderful way for everyday investors to grow their wealth safely through properties. Just like how Blackstone made money on their basket of property investments. Yet many investors behave as if they don’t know this asset class. When a recession hits, they sell off some of the most valuable assets in their portfolio. Just look at the recent Singapore REIT performance in the chart below.  Source: Singapore Exchange You see, a REIT, like any other property investing, has a very simple business model. And it’s what I like to call a “virtual bank”. Let me explain. A REIT borrows cheap, short-term debt from the bank, and invests into “long-term”, high-yielding properties like retail and office buildings. If you invest in a REIT, you get to keep the rental income a REIT collects as dividends. While waiting for the property’s value to grow. This makes REITs the most profitable and stable form of leveraged investing. Especially if you want to retire with a dividend portfolio. Pandemic or Crisis… REITs Are a Dividend Machine Now, I’m writing this because REITs have performed poorly because of the whole pandemic crisis. And I want to share with you what I think are the best Singapore REITs out there. Actually, I used to be a bonds analyst checking out which companies wouldn’t go bust. And I applied this rigorous research to REITs, to make sure their dividends don’t go bust over the long run. Especially if you’re building an income portfolio for retirement. So, if you want to invest in a REIT, you need to make sure they’re the best. And they can survive an extended crisis. Onward. Best Singapore REIT No. 1 — CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust Ticker: C38U.SI Market Cap: SGD13 billion Forward Dividend Yield: 6.20% CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust, or CILT, after the merger of CapitaLand Mall Trust and CapitaLand Commercial Trust, is the biggest REIT in Singapore. It’s also the third largest REIT in Asia. And it’s interesting, you see, a particular group of Singapore REITs undergoing major shifts. I’ll explain. For one, you’re seeing REITs owning more and more mixed-development sites — combining both retail and commercial spaces into one area. This makes a lot of sense here, especially with a limited land supply in Singapore. Many properties have to become more efficient to provide people with a convenient “work-life-play” environment. Another is this — with the pandemic crisis ongoing, having a mix of retail and offices properties allows some sector diversification. While everyone is aware of the supposedly “REIT Armageddon”, shopping malls are wrecked by the new normal of “work from home”. And a lot of people are sticking to shopping online. But that’s only half the story told. CILT: A “Recovery” Dividend Stock A lot of retail malls are still very much in huge demand in the suburban area. With Phase 2 out, CILT’s retail properties’ foot traffic has already recovered to 60% of pre-pandemic levels. What’s more interesting is this. Tenant sales have recovered to 90% of its pre-pandemic levels. And many the REIT is still able to lock in tenants, with occupancy rates close to full. These suburban malls are a very good catchment area for the local population living away from the city centre. You see, many people still enjoy shopping in these heartland areas. Usually, making their grocery shopping. In fact, CILT retail malls’ supermarket sales have gone up by 9.6% year on year. In the latest quarter, home furnishing, sporting goods, electronics all seen an increase in sales. Its worst hit is Raffles City Singapore, which saw a major drop in rental reversions. But that’s because Raffles City is located in the city centre. Of course, CILT’s also the largest owner of Grade-A prime assets in Singapore’s CBD. These top office spaces are well occupied by some of the biggest, profitable companies in the world. From banks to tech, to aviation and commodities companies. While most people are working from home, these companies still retain their tenancy with the properties. You’d see that all of its properties are still well-occupied. Sometimes, investing can be simple. Best Singapore REIT No. 2 — Ascendas Real Estate Investment Trust Ticker: A17U.SI Market Cap: SGD11 billion Forward Dividend Yield: 4.56% Ascendas Real Estate Investment Trust is traditionally Singapore’s largest industrial REIT. But recently, you’d see Ascendas diversifying its “property mix”, moving into “business & science” parks. Which has done very well for them. You see, these properties are home to some of the biggest, most stable companies in the technology, financial and biomedical sectors — DSO National Laboratories, DBS Bank, Singapore Telecommunications and J.P.Morgan Chase Bank are some of their biggest tenants. This allows them to capture companies at the forefront of technology, finance and biomedical science. And not one single tenant takes up more than 5% of Ascendas’ gross rental income. This is important here. Because Ascendas does not have to rely on any tenants to grow. If anyone decides to leave, Ascendas can easily fill up its space without worrying about crushing its rental income. This diversification makes investing in Ascendas REIT safe. In fact, during the pandemic crisis, only 9 tenants out of its over 1,400 tenants have pre-cancelled their leases. And they still managed to maintain at least 91% occupancy rate. With Ascendas’ track record of accumulating high quality properties, it shows in their financial results. Ascendas’ Financials Staying Strong Ascendas’ 1H2020 gross rental income grew 14.6% from SGD455 million to SGD521 million. Its total distribution was higher by 3.7% to SGD263 million during the same period. Ascendas’ continues to gush free cash flow (FCF). In fact, FCF grew from SGD35 million in FY2004 to a massive SGD612 million in FY2019. Note: FY2019 results account for 9 months of rent, due to a change in financial period ending from Mar to Dec. If you’d held Ascendas since its IPO in 2002, you’d have made more than 500% (as at Dec 2020) on your capital, including dividends. That’s returns of close to 11% per year. I’d note it has SGD2 billion worth of pipeline from its Sponsor, CapitaLand Ltd and redevelopment opportunities worth SGD360 million. That makes Ascendas’ growth predictable. Ascendas’ balance sheet remained very healthy, with a low gearing ratio of 35%. In my opinion, Ascendas has plenty of firepower to buy more properties. It can borrow debt safely, and cheaply because of the REIT’s very strong credit quality. The biggest risk for Ascendas comes from its food and events-related tenants. That’s why its logistics & distribution centres, and “high-specification” industrial centres rents suffered. These tenants were affected by the pandemic, which forced Ascendas to drop its rents to retain these SME tenants. As mentioned earlier, Ascendas’ well-diversified tenants could keep its rental income resilient. Its other segments had positive rental adjustments. Ascendas REIT currently has a dividend yield of around 4.56%. with a current price/book valuation of around 1.4x, you’d have to pay a slightly higher premium for its overall properties’ growth potential. If you’re a dividend investor looking to grow your retirement portfolio, perhaps Ascendas REIT is worth a buy. Sometimes, investing can be simple. Best Singapore REIT No. 3 — Mapletree Industrial Trust Ticker: ME8U.SI Market Cap: SGD6.9 billion Forward Dividend Yield: 4.05% Maple Industrial Trust knows about the potential of the “new-age” digital economy. And they’re preparing for it. Its surprise move to buy 14 data centres in the US fit well into owning buildings for knowledge-intensive sectors. And their data centres are almost fully occupied. Today, Mapletree Industrial owns 84 industrial properties in Singapore and 27 properties in the US. More than half of these buildings are specially designed for its 2,000 over tenants needing huge technology infrastructure — including the big companies like Hewlett-Packard, AT&T, ThermoFisher Scientific and ST Telemedia. More people and companies are consuming more and more data. Be it moving into cloud or streaming videos. Mapletree Industrial is the landlord many technology-savvy tenants like telecommunications and internet companies will go to. And it’s also in line with the global shift toward adopting a “work-from-home” structure. In my opinion, there’s strong demand for reliable, specialized buildings in developed countries. And its numbers are showing. While Mapletree Industrial’s 1HYFY20/21 gross rental income remained flat during the pandemic, its total distribution for 1HFY20/21 rose 14% to SGD144 million, compared to last year. Similarly, it maintained its abundant free cash flow (FCF) of SGD104 million during the same period. In fact, its FCF continuously grew from SGD132 million in FY2011 and more than doubled to SGD287 million as of March 2020. Now, since its listing in 2010, Mapletree Industrial steadily grew its distribution per unit (DPU) from 3.45 cents to 12.24 cents during its latest FY19/20. Distribution per unit is what unitholders could collect as dividends. So far, its stock performance has rewarded unitholders well. Mapletree Industrial’s Stock Performance At Top Speed In fact, in my opinion, you’re sitting on the best performing Singapore REIT, if you’d bought Mapletree Industrial since IPO. Its stock made its unitholders close to 15% annual returns on their capital, including dividends (as of Dec 2020). You see, the REIT has a knack for picking solid, high quality assets. And these assets have proved to provide a stable, growing form of income for its unitholders. With the massive rise of traffic data, income growth will come from both its data centres and “hi-tech” buildings. Mapletree Industrial’s balance sheet is strong. Its gearing ratio is around 38%. This gives the REIT plenty of room to grow. What’s even better is this. Mapletree Industrial gets to buy all the good properties from its strong sponsor, Mapletree Investments. But the biggest problem Mapletree Industrial is facing now, like Ascendas REIT, is its large SME tenant base. 40% of its portfolio are SME tenants, and many have suffered during the pandemic crisis. So far, Mapletree Industrial could control its rental arrears to about 1.4% of its past 12 months gross rental income. And 90% of its tenants have resumed operations after the Circuit Breaker (7 Apr to 1 Jun 2020) period. Today, Mapletree Industrial has a current dividend yield of around 4.05%. And if you’re a dividend investor looking to build your retirement portfolio, perhaps this is one stable industrial REIT worth a buy. Sometimes, investing can be simple. Best Singapore REIT No. 4 — Mapletree Logistics Trust Ticker: M44U.SI Market Cap: SGD7.9 billion Forward Dividend Yield: 5.47% When you buy “stuff” online, it takes a couple of days, or weeks for the items to reach your home. And big e-commerce companies like Lazada, Shopee, or even Watsons first need to put the products in warehouses, before it gets delivered to you. You see, Mapletree Logistics Trust is responsible for taking care of all the different types of daily essential products — like food, drinks and healthcare products before it gets delivered to the end customers. And Mapletree Logistics manages these warehouses in some of the 146 properties it owns across Asia. Close to 700 of their tenants are mostly in consumer-related sectors, selling daily essentials. That’s why there’s a huge need to store all these items. Mapletree Logistics Riding On The E-Commerce Wave With the rising trend of e-commerce, especially during the pandemic crisis, it’s crucial Mapletree Logistics continues to provide their tenants with the best logistics facilities. Mapletree Logistics’ 1HFY20/21 gross rental income grew 9.4% to SGD264 million, compared to a year ago. Its total distribution to unitholders grew 6% to SGD156 million during the same period. And this was due to higher rent adjustments from many of its properties. Mapletree Logistics Trust has been well managed. It could grow its distributions or net earnings from SGD10 million in FY2005 to SGD302 million as of FY2020. Its free cash flow has been massive, hitting SGD370 million as of the latest financial year results. This is largely due to its high quality properties and the ability to have cheap borrowing costs. And management is happy to maintain its gearing ratio — which is 39.5%. This means they can continue to grow more properties before they hit the 50% gearing limit set by the MAS. One major risk is Mapletree Logistics’ largest tenant — CWT Group, which remains its largest Singapore tenant, at 8.6% of the REIT’s gross rental income. You see, CWT Group defaulted on its bank loans early last year. But, so far, the company still has committed to pay rent to Mapletree Logistics. With a diversified portfolio of properties and tenants, even if CWT Group decides to pull out, Mapletree Logistics should have no trouble finding new tenants. If you’re a dividend investor looking to build your retirement portfolio, perhaps this is one stable industrial REIT worth a buy. Sometimes, investing can be simple. Best Singapore REIT No. 5 — Ascott Residence Trust Ticker: HMN.SI Market Cap: SGD3 billion Forward Dividend Yield: 5.33% Ascott Residence Trust is focused on serviced residences, hotels, business hotels and rental housing. Short term or long haul stay. And its properties are located across key, developed markets, including China, Japan, UK and the US. Following its merger with Ascendas Hospitality Trust in December 2019, Ascott’s portfolio is worth more than SGD7 billion, with 88 properties more than 16,000 units across 15 countries worldwide — including China, Japan, UK and the US. While the pandemic has put all travels to a stop, Ascott Residence’s long term outlook is still very bright. Ascott Residence Positioned For A Major Travel Rebound You see, travel demand can never go away. Think about how globalized today’s world is. And hotel giant Marriott knows this. It recently announced plans to open 40 to 50 new hotels in Asia and another 100 next year as it expects travel to recover gradually. You see, the concern really is not the lack of demand for travel in the long run, but the severe cash crunch managed by these REITs. Even though Ascott Residence suffered a huge drop in gross rental income, its master lease and management contracts have continued to support REIT through the pandemic crisis. These contracts provide a very steady, 50% of the REIT’s gross rental income. Its financial position is strong. Ascott Residence recently refinanced all of its debt in 2020, and has maintained a very low borrowing cost of 1.8% per year. Ascott Residence knows it has the money — with SGD305 million in cash, and SGD550 million of bank credit facilities, to be drawn anytime. The REIT has a very low gearing ratio of 34.6%, meaning it still has a lot of room for growth too. If you’re a contrarian income investor looking to bet on a huge rebound in travel, perhaps Ascott Residence is one stock you want to be looking at. Sometimes, investing can be simple. Best Singapore REIT No. 6 — Frasers Centrepoint Trust Ticker: J69U.SI Market Cap: SGD3.9 billion Forward Dividend Yield: 5.15% You’d probably know most of the retail malls were wrecked during the pandemic crisis. But here’s where the real difference lies for Frasers Centrepoint Trust. The truth is, the ones getting crushed by the pandemic are the malls located in the city centre. Why? Because, in my opinion, they’re usually made up of the office crowd and tourists. Which now have mostly disappeared. But, demand for retail “heartland” shopping still exists even during the pandemic. And Frasers Centrepoint owns all these “heartland” malls. I’ll explain. Frasers Centrepoint Is A Heartland Mall Dominator You see, many of the REIT’s malls are well located in Singapore’s suburban areas. Where it captures the local residential population. When the Singapore government announced Phase 2 of Circuit Breaker, many shoppers in fact, returned to these heartland malls. And these malls have stabilized to 60% to 70% of the pre-pandemic level. Think about it. If you’re still working from home,  you want to quickly head to a nearby place to grab food or buy any last minute “daily essentials”. Or if you’d want to get out for a walk, the most convenient place to go to is your local heartland mall. I know Frasers Centrepoint’s latest 2H2020 (Apr to Sep) results were poor. Gross rental income and net earnings were down 32.5% and 61% year on year respectively. But I’d say, Frasers Centrepoint is suffering temporary pain. Its mall occupancy rate is still around 95%. And this is important here. Because, what these retail malls are lacking isn’t shoppers demand, but the ability to ride through a crisis. Now, Frasers Centrepoint has a very strong balance sheet. It still maintains a high quality “investment grade” credit rating during the pandemic. Which means it can refinance and borrow debt at a cheap cost. Even better, it’s what makes it have a high interest coverage ratio of 5x. You see, its recent purchase of the remaining 63.1% of AsiaRetail Fund is the right move for this heartland dominator. Frasers Centrepoint is eventually going to capture the returning wave of shoppers. AsiaRetail Fund currently owns five Singapore heartland malls — Tiong Bahru Plaza, White Sands, Hougang Mall, Century Square and Tampines 1. All located near the MRT station and command high foot traffic. And these malls are in areas where there are limited or no big competing shopping malls around. This means, in the long run, Frasers Centrepoint gets to enjoy heartland dominance. Sometimes, investing can be simple. Best Singapore REIT No. 7 — Keppel DC REIT Ticker: AJBU.SI Market Cap: SGD4.56 billion Forward Dividend Yield: 2.90% Keppel DC REIT is a specialized SGD4.8 billion real estate investment trust. Unlike the other Singapore REITs, Keppel DC is the only “pure-play” data centre REIT to be listed since 2014. Today, Keppel DC has 18 data centres, mostly in Asia. 6 of its data centres are in Singapore. Now, data centres are huge, dedicated spaces for high-powered computers. These systems run massive amounts of data every second — from streaming online videos to surfing your social media. And digital content is growing. That’s why most of its tenants are internet companies, telecom operators and IT services. Because there’s so much demand for data traffic now, tenants need to make sure these spaces have specialized, reliable equipment like cooling systems and infrastructure to make sure nothing goes wrong. You see, Keppel DC knows it’s going to benefit from the massive growth in the new digital economy. People are going into cloud adoption, artificial intelligence, 5G advances, and the “Internet of Things”. In fact, in my opinion, all of these are expected to grow at least double-digits over the next 10 years. According to management, data centre spending in Asia Pacific is expected to exceed US$30 billion by 2023. That’s going to account more than 30% of the global market. Keppel DC Growing At Breakneck Speed So far, the digital tailwind has rewarded the REIT very well. In 3Q2020, gross rental income exploded 46% year over year to SGD67.7 million. From Jan till Sep 2020, Keppel DC has collected SGD192 million of gross rental income. That’s up a huge 35% year over year. Since its IPO, Keppel DC more than tripled its free cash flow from SGD34 million to SGD113 million just last year. This allowed it to reward growing dividends to its unitholders year after year. Now, 70% of Keppel DC’s gross rental income has a shorter, 3 years lease. This gives Keppel DC more room to adjust for higher rents to capture the growing demands for data centres. Even with its huge growth, Keppel DC maintains a healthy financial position. Even banks know of its very high quality assets — and are willing to lend them at a very low borrowing cost 1.6% per year. This is what makes Keppel DC maintain a very high interest coverage ratio of 13x. Since its gearing ratio is only at 35%, it has much room to grow its acquisitions. In fact, it recently completed its acquisition at Keppel DC Dublin 1 and Kelsterbach Data Centre in Germany in March and May 2020 earlier this year. Both properties command a high occupancy rate of 81% and 100% respectively. One key risk for Keppel DC is the growing competition with other data centre providers globally. Management has been very careful with acquisitions. If you see, Keppel DC’s properties are all fully occupied, or undergoing some form of renovation to improve its occupancy rate. Only its Basis Bay Data Centre has a low occupancy rate of 63%. But, so far that’s a tiny contribution to its overall rental income. Sometimes, investing can be simple. Best Singapore REIT No. 8 — Parkway Life REIT Ticker: C2PU.SI Market Cap: SGD2.34 billion Forward Dividend Yield: 3.62% Developed countries often face one big, common problem. An aging population. You see, Japan has the highest old-age dependency ratio of all OECD countries. 1 in 3 Japanese will be over 65 years old by 2050. This means the country has more old people than young ones who can reasonably support the country in the future. And the government is worried. This means healthcare costs are going up and it’s critical to provide a good place to take care of the elderly. And that’s why Parkway Life REIT or PLife is the REIT to position itself in this market. You see, it’s very diversified portfolio of 53 properties owns some of the best nursing homes in Japan. Though it’s a much smaller REIT than the other Singapore REITs, it is, in my opinion, the best of the best healthcare REIT. Healthcare Investing Is A Solid Wealth Defense PLife owns 49 properties across Japan, which are well-located in the dense, residential districts of big cities. All of its properties are fully leased to various nursing home operators, with the big operators contributing more than 50% of its Japan nursing home rental income. These are long term leases expiring in 11 years. And most of its properties have a yearly rent review. In Singapore, PLife also owns some world-class local private hospitals — Mount Elizabeth Hospital, Gleneagles Hospital and Parkway East Hospital. Pandemic or not, even in Singapore, the demand for healthcare is getting important. Very rich people would pay to fly here to Singapore to have their health treated in one of these hospitals. Now, these hospitals are master leased to IHH Group, Asia’s largest private healthcare group listed in both Malaysia and Singapore. And they’re very profitable in South East Asia, having been owned by Japan’s 2nd largest trading company, Mitsui & Co, and the Government of Malaysia. Gross rental income is split equally between its Singapore and Japan assets. You’d say both Singapore and Japan are the twin income engines for the REIT. Its latest 3Q2020 results have been resilient, growing its year-to-date gross rental income to SGD90 million. While it’s distributable income to unitholders grew 3.8% to SGD61 million and 7.4% to SGD21 million. PLife’s properties provide a very predictable form of cash flow. Free cash flow has been stable, growing from SGD65 million in 2010 to SGD80 million in 2019. Since its IPO in FY2007, it grew its distribution per unit (DPU) from 6.32 cents to 13.19 cents in FY2019. This gives income investors a very stable form of dividend income. And if you’d held PLife since its IPO, you’d made an annual total return of close to 11%, including dividends. Making it one of the best performing Singapore REITs (as at Dec 2020). Balance sheet is strong. Its gearing is at a healthy 38.6%, while its interest coverage ratio is 17x. This is because its Japanese properties can borrow at very cheap cost, in Japanese Yen. While its key growth markets are in Singapore and Japan, PLife is also looking beyond other developed markets including Australia, Europe and the United Kingdom. Sometimes, investing can be simple. Conclusion — Your 8 Best Singapore REITs You know, this list was originally a “10 Best Singapore REITs” list. But researching on 8 REIT alone can be darn tiring. Anyway, I still have two more REITs I like to talk about. But, I’ll keep it for later next time. Need a break. All these 8 Singapore REITs are a great way for you to get started, especially if you’re a dividend investor looking to grow your wealth in retirement safely. 4 STOCKS THIS WEEK Singtel (Z74); StarHub (CC3); NetLink (CJLU): Local Telcos Dividend Yield And Share Price Performance BRANDED CONTENT Cashback Vs Miles: How To Enjoy The Best Of Both Worlds MONEY Complete Guide To Multi-Currency Accounts And Wallets In Singapore [YouTrip, Revolut, Wise, DBS My Account, UOB Mighty FX And More] INSIGHTS 7 International Rankings That Singaporeans Enjoy PROPERTY En Bloc Deal: 3 Ways You Can Still Not Make Any Money COLUMNS 8 Things You Need To Know Before Heading To The Money Changer BRANDED CONTENT Why Homeowners Should Avoid Overspending on Their HDB Flats MONEY 11 Joints Savings Account To Open With Your Spouse Or Parents BONDS AND FIXED INCOME Step By Step Guide To Buying T-Bills Online Using Your CPF OA Savings ESTATE GUIDE Neighbourhood Estate Guide: Rediscovering Jurong East, The Regional Centre Of The West                     Copyright © 2019 DollarsAndSense. \n",

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING 5 Things You Need to Know About Investing Through The Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) Earning tax relief on your SRS savings isn’t enough. To plan for your retirement, you also need to invest your SRS savings. by This article was written in collaboration with MoneyOwl. All views expressed in this article are the independent opinion of DollarsAndSense.sg based on our research. DollarsAndSense.sg is not liable for any financial losses that may arise from any transactions and readers are encouraged to do their own due diligence. You can view our full editorial policy here. The end of year period is when many of us would look to optimise tax savings. One such method is through the Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS). The Supplementary Retirement Scheme is part of the government’s multi-pronged strategy to help Singaporeans build up savings for our retirement. Unlike CPF contributions from our salary, contributions to our SRS account are voluntary. The main reason to top up our SRS account is to enjoy dollar-for-dollar tax relief, up to a maximum of $15,300 for Singaporeans and Permanent Residents (PRs), and $35,700 for foreigners working in Singapore. The end-of-year period is also when some financial institutions may also offer attractive promotions if you invest SRS funds through them. Read Also: Complete Guide To Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) Account For Foreigners In Singapore Since the SRS is meant to provide us with retirement income during our golden years, there are withdrawal rules that we need to take note of. If we withdraw funds from our SRS account before the statutory retirement age (currently 62), the full withdrawal amount will be subject to income tax. In addition, there will also be a 5% penalty on the withdrawal amount. For example, if we withdraw $40,000, there will be a penalty of $2,000 (5%) that we will pay. If a withdrawal is made before the statutory retirement age due to death or medical grounds, 50% of the withdrawal amount will be subject to income tax. If the withdrawal is made before the statutory retirement age due to bankruptcy, 100% of the withdrawal amount will be subject to income tax. In all of these cases, there will be no 5% penalty payable. If we make withdrawals after reaching the statutory retirement age, we will receive a 50% tax concession on our withdrawal amount. For example, if we withdraw $40,000 from our SRS account for the year, only $20,000 will be considered as taxable income. Also, there will be no penalty imposed on our withdrawal amount. Besides understanding the SRS withdrawal rules, we also need to understand some other areas pertaining to the SRS. #1 How Much Tax Relief We Enjoy Depends On The Income Tax Bracket We Are In Singapore practices a progressive tax system. This means that the personal income tax rate increases as the taxable income increases. For those who need to pay personal income tax, the tax rate can be as little as 2% to as high as 22%. For example, an individual with a chargeable income of $80,000 will pay $3,350 in income tax. In contrast, a person with a chargeable income of $40,000 will pay $550, which is about six times lower.   If both individuals contribute $5,000 to their SRS account, the person with the higher chargeable income of $80,000 will enjoy a tax savings of $350. The person with the lower chargeable income of $40,000 will enjoy a tax savings of $175 since the person is in a lower tax bracket. Before contributing to our SRS account, it’s important to first know which tax bracket we fall within. This will determine how much tax savings we enjoy if we contribute to our SRS account for the year. The higher the tax savings, the greater the motivation to contribute to our SRS account. #2 We Should Seek to Invest Our SRS Monies Unlike funds in our CPF accounts that earn us a risk-free return of between 2.5% to 6.0% per annum (p.a.), funds in our SRS account will only earn us a nominal interest rate of 0.05% p.a., which is obviously not good enough. Unless you are close to retirement (e.g. you are 61 this year and intend to withdraw the money next year), it makes sense to invest our SRS monies to ensure that it earns higher returns. This is especially true if we still have a long-time horizon to our retirement. For example, a person who is 42 this year will still have 20 years before they will start making withdrawals from their SRS account. This gives them sufficient time to invest and earn a higher return in the financial markets while being able to ride out market volatility. #3 We Don’t Need to Invest Through the Agent Bank We Open an SRS Account With Similar to the CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS), we will need to open an SRS account with one of the three local banks in Singapore – DBS; OCBC; UOB. We can only hold one SRS account at any point in time. If we have opened an SRS account with one of the agent banks and wish to switch to another bank, we can do so. It’s important to note that the responsibility of the agent banks is to hold the SRS monies on our behalf in accordance with the laws that govern it. The agent banks do not invest nor manage any of the funds in our SRS account for us. Funds in our SRS account can only be invested or withdrawn as per our instruction. One misconception is that we can only invest with the agent bank that we open an SRS account with. This isn’t true. Any SRS-approved investments can be made through our SRS account, regardless of which agent bank we open an SRS account with. For example, whether we open an SRS account with DBS, OCBC or UOB, we can still invest our SRS savings through a platform such as MoneyOwl. The agent bank you open your SRS account with does not restrict you from any SRS-eligible investments you wish to make. From now till 31 December 2020, MoneyOwl has an SRS Promo where you can get up to $200 worth of eCapitaVouchers if you invest your SRS savings through them.  #4 Types of Investments We Can Make While we can’t use our SRS monies to invest in a property, overseas stocks or commodities, there are still multiple investments that we can make using our SRS account. For example, there are many stocks, REITs, ETFs and bonds listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) that we can invest in using our SRS monies. If we prefer to gain exposure to overseas markets, we can consider investing our SRS monies via unit trusts such as those offered by MoneyOwl. This will allow us to gain exposure to a wide range of globally diversified stocks and bonds. As always, the level of risk we are willing and able to take on will determine our investment portfolio’s asset allocation. Those who prefer an instrument that can provide us with regular income streams during our retirement can consider getting a retirement income insurance plan using our SRS savings. Such plans are designed to provide us with a steady stream of regular income (guaranteed + non-guaranteed) during our retirement years and are an excellent complement to our CPF LIFE payouts. You can find out more about such SRS-approved retirement plans with MoneyOwl. When it comes to our SRS investments, we should ideally be investing based on a long-term investment strategy, and in assets that we are comfortable with. After all, the investments we made via our SRS savings are clearly earmarked for our retirement. This falls nicely in line with MoneyOwl’s investment philosophy which focuses on generating returns to achieve your long-term financial goals. Read Also: Investing With MoneyOwl: Here’s What You Need To Know Before You Invest With Them To be clear, whether we use our SRS money to invest in unit trusts and retirement income insurance plans, or prefer funding them using cash, the investment products that we are getting are the same. The key difference is that by using our SRS account, we get to enjoy immediate tax savings, on top of the returns that we can get from these investments. #5 The Statutory Retirement Age When We Can Start Making Penalty-Free Withdrawals Is Based On When Your First SRS Contribution Was Made As stated in point 1, SRS account holders can make penalty-free withdrawals from their accounts when they reach the statutory retirement age (currently 62). They also enjoy a 50% tax concession for the amount that they withdraw from their accounts. What fewer people know is that the statutory retirement age is based on when your first SRS contribution was made. As announced in last year’s National Day Rally, the statutory retirement age will increase to 63 in 2022, and eventually move up to 65 by 2030. So if you want to make a penalty-free withdrawal from 62, it might be logical to open and contribute to your SRS account soon, before the statutory retirement age increases.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING How Older Singaporeans Can Continue Using CPF To Enjoy Higher Risk-Free Returns After Age 55 We actually have more options for our CPF balances after turning 55. by For many Singaporeans and PRs, our 55th birthday marks the age we can finally withdraw some of our hard-earned savings from our CPF accounts. We can withdraw at least $5,000 from our CPF Ordinary Account and Special Account balances, and if we have more than the Full Retirement Sum (FRS), we can withdraw anything above that. In 2021, the Full Retirement Sum is $186,000. For those who want to continue keeping our money in CPF, it is not compulsory to withdraw any amount. Read Also: How Much Can You Withdraw From Your CPF Account At Age 55 In fact, we can continue to enjoy higher risk-free returns by keeping our money in CPF than compared to the banks! In addition, we can also utilise CPF to grow our savings at a good interest rate past the age of 55. Here are 3 ways we thought of (and you can let us know if there are other hacks we may have missed out). #1 Keep Our Emergency Funds In Our CPF Rather than withdrawing what we can in cash, we can make use of our CPF to store our emergency funds. All of us need to keep an emergency fund anyway, and being able to keep it in our CPF allows us to earn up to 6% returns, compared to the 0.05% we typically get in our savings account. We need our emergency funds to be fairly liquid – which is why keeping it in our savings account, or even earning a slightly higher interest return on the Singapore Savings Bonds (SSBs) or cash management account are necessary. However, after turning 55, CPF allows us to withdraw “in full or partially, as frequently as you like, and at any time”. Once we decide to make a withdrawal, we can receive it “almost instantly” (if we are registered for PayNow). Once we adopt this strategy, we can effectively use any amount we are eligible to withdraw from our CPF as our emergency funds. We are also not deprived of any cash flow, as we can make use of the amount we were already keeping as our emergency fund in our savings account. #2 Keeping A Higher Interest “Fixed Deposit” When we turn 55, we need to set our retirement sum aside – in our newly opened Retirement Account (RA). Even after setting this sum aside, we continue to add to our CPF balances with mandatory contributions from our salary, if we continue working. Our contribution rates are as follows: As we can see, we do not contribute to our Retirement Account even if we continue working after 55. This doesn’t necessarily mean we can withdraw these savings – as we still need to meet our Full Retirement Sum (locked at the year we turn 55), before being able to make additional withdrawals from our CPF. Read Also: Complete Guide To Your CPF Contributions In Singapore: Salary Caps, Contribution Rates And Allocation Rates What it does mean, however, is that these additional CPF contributions may never go into CPF LIFE when we turn 65. For those of us who have set aside our Full Retirement Sum, we retain the flexibility to withdraw our CPF savings any time we like. Hence, our mandatory CPF contributions via our salary can be taken as a “fixed deposit” that we can withdraw when we want as well. Even for those of us who have not kept the Full Retirement Sum and cannot make withdrawals, we can still utilise these funds as a “fixed deposit” earning good interest of up to 4% in our Special Account. Rather than topping up our Retirement Account, we also have the option to treat it as funds we want to pass on to our beneficiaries. #3 Continue Contributing To Our Retirement Income Once we turn 55 and set aside our retirement sum, we may think we have done enough for our retirement savings, especially if we are able to hit the Full Retirement Sum. This is entirely untrue. The Full Retirement Sum is merely an amount set by the government rather than based on our individual needs. Furthermore, CPF LIFE monthly payouts are only meant to afford a basic standard of retirement. Read Also: [Beginners’ Guide] Understanding CPF LIFE And Your Monthly Payouts  When You Retire In Singapore Even after turning 55 and whether or not we hit the Full Retirement Sum, we can still continue to add to our retirement income by topping up our Retirement Account up to the Enhanced Retirement Sum (ERS). On a side note, by topping up our Retirement Account via the Retirement Sum Topping Up (RSTU) Scheme, we can continue to earn tax deductions. This may also make slightly more sense when we are over 55, as our employee CPF contributions fall from 20% to 13%. This actually means the taxable income of employees above 55 earning $6,000 a month goes up. The Utility Of CPF Does Not End At 55 For many of us, we will continue working beyond the age of 55. This is simply a function of increasing retirement age and life expectancy. At the same time, hitting the milestone age of 55, when we can withdraw a lump sum amount from our CPF, does not mean the usefulness of CPF is limited. We can continue to make full use of our CPF to earn higher risk-free interest return on our funds.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING How To Continue Planning For Your Future Retirement (Safely) During The COVID-19 Recession Retirement planning should continue even during a recession. by This article was written in collaboration with CPF Board. All views expressed in this article are the independent opinion of DollarsAndSense.sg based on our research. DollarsAndSense.sg is not liable for any financial losses that may arise from any transactions and readers are encouraged to do their own due diligence. You can view our full editorial policy here. If you have found 2020 to be a challenging year, you are not alone. Across the world, the COVID-19 pandemic has not only affected millions of lives but also adversely impacted the global economy. Singapore has not been spared. According to the Ministry of Manpower, there are only 0.57 job vacancies available for every unemployed person. The Straits Times Index (STI), which tracks the performance of the 30 strongest stocks listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX), is also down about 16% since the start of this year (as of 11 November 2020). On a personal level, many of us had to adjust to working-from-home and home-based learning, and it has not been easy. Given the more immediate concerns in 2020, it may be convenient to postpone planning for the future. We may reason that thinking about tomorrow’s problem isn’t helpful if we can’t solve today’s issues first. While this may apply to some things in our lives, such as putting off the purchase of a new car or property, there are other areas that we should not put on hold even during economic uncertainty. For example, none of us would want to disrupt our kids’ education because of a recession. As far as possible, we would want to ensure continuity in their education even if we are facing some financial constraint, because we understand that any disruption may do more harm than good. Likewise, we want to continue planning towards our future through both good and bad times. This is because our retirement plan is a long-term goal and we should minimise disruption to it. What we choose to do now will affect our future greatly. The Best Time To Start Retirement Planning Is When We First Start Working A common misconception that people have is that retirement planning is something that we only need to think about when we are older. However, the trick to a successful retirement plan is to utilise the power of compound interest as much as we can. And this is best done when we start young. For example, if we set aside $10,000 in retirement savings at age 25 and retire at age 65, we will have 40 years to utilise the power of compound interest. At an interest rate of 4.0% p.a., our retirement savings will grow to become $48,010 by age 65! But if we only start saving towards our retirement at age 55, we will need to set aside $32,434 to achieve the same $48,010 by age 65, assuming the interest rate remains the same at 4.0%. This also means we need to save three times more to get the same retirement amount if we start 30 years later! In Singapore, We Contribute To Our Retirement Savings Whenever We Work The good news for Singapore citizens and PRs is that even during a recession, we will still be contributing to our retirement savings when we are working. This is because 20% of our salary each month automatically goes to our CPF accounts. Also, our employers contribute a further 17%. This percentage is lower for those above the age of 55. In other words, the design of the CPF system allows Singaporeans and PRs to start building up their retirement savings from their first paycheque, without having to make a conscious effort. Our CPF savings also grows at a risk-free base interest rate of between 2.5% [Ordinary Account (OA)] to 4.0% p.a. (Special, MediSave and Retirement Accounts). In addition, the first $60,000 of our combined CPF balances earns an additional 1% p.a. interest, while those above 55 can earn an additional 2% p.a. on the first $30,000, and 1% p.a. on the next $30,000. For example, a 30-year old who contributes $1,000 a month to his CPF Ordinary Account (OA) will earn a minimum of 2.5% p.a. By age 55 – 25 years later – the $1,000 contribution would have grown into $1,854 based on a return of 2.5% p.a. (though the actual return would be higher due to the extra 1% p.a. interest for the first $60,000 of combined CPF balances). Contributing to our CPF Special Account (SA) will yield even better returns. Earn Higher Returns By Transferring Our Ordinary Account Savings To Our Special Account If we wish to earn a higher risk-free return, a fool-proof way is to transfer funds from our OA to our SA. By doing so, we can earn 4.0% p.a. instead of 2.5% p.a. For example, if we have $10,000 in our OA today, this will grow to $18,540 after 25 years (based on 2.5% p.a.). However, if we transfer the $10,000 to our SA, the funds will grow to $26,658 (based on 4.0% p.a.) after 25 years, earning us an additional $8,118. You can see the stark difference in the graph below:  To be clear, transferring funds from your OA to your SA isn’t without trade-offs. Once the funds are transferred to our SA, the decision is irreversible, and we cannot transfer it back to our OA. This also means that we cannot utilise the money for OA-eligible payments such as our home mortgage. However, if the goal is to plan towards a more comfortable retirement without needing to take on any investment risk, then the SA is the perfect place to grow our retirement savings safely, during both good and bad times. Use The Retirement Sum Topping-Up Scheme To Grow Our Retirement Savings As a Singaporean, if we want to build up our retirement savings without taking on investment risk, the Retirement Sum Topping-Up Scheme (RSTU) is one of the most powerful tools we can utilise as a CPF member. Doing so automatically allows us to earn a risk-free rate of up to 6% p.a. to put aside for our retirement. Through RSTU, we can make cash top-ups to our own and/or our loved one’s SA up to the current Full Retirement Sum ($181,000 as of 2020). If we or our recipients are above 55, we can do a top-up to our Retirement Account (RA), up to the current Enhanced Retirement Sum ($271,500 as of 2020). To put things into perspective, $10,000 today will become $21,911 in retirement savings after 20 years! In addition, we can also enjoy tax relief of up to $7,000 per year if we are topping up for ourselves, and an additional $7,000 per year if we are topping up for our loved ones’ SA or RA. Read Also: Retirement Sum Topping-Up Scheme (RSTU) VS CPF Voluntary Contributions: What’s The Difference? For members above age 55, our CPF RA is a great place to park and continue growing our retirement savings. This is particularly true during this volatile period when investors in the financial markets have to face a higher level of uncertainty if they invest in equities, or need to accept low interest rates if they choose to invest in fixed income instruments such as corporate bonds. For example, a 55-year-old male (as of 2020) who wishes to retire at age 65 can choose to commence his CPF LIFE payouts in 10 years. If he has the Full Retirement Sum (FRS) of $181,000 (as of 2020) in his RA today, he will receive an estimated payout of between $1,411 to $1,556 each month under the Standard Plan from age 65 onwards.  Let’s assume he has $50,000 in stocks and bonds that are meant for his retirement. If he is not confident of investing in the financial markets in the next few years but would like to continue growing the money for his retirement, a secure and risk-free way of doing so would be to make a $50,000 top-up to his RA today. By doing so, he will be able to increase his monthly CPF LIFE payout at age 65 to $1,765 – $1,950 a month instead.  Whether you are a fresh graduate who has just entered the workforce or an older worker who intends to retire in a few years, growing your retirement savings can still be done safely even during a recession. As CPF members, we can be assured that our CPF savings will continue to compound at a safe, reasonable rate even when the financial markets are in distress.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING Should You Make Lump Sum Top-Ups Or Regular Contributions For The CPF Retirement Sum Topping-Up Scheme The sooner you make your top-ups, the sooner they can begin generating decent risk-free returns for you. by By now, you’re probably familiar with the benefits of making voluntary CPF top-ups – such as tax reliefs, government matching, or to earn guaranteed, risk-free interest to achieve 1M65. So if you’ve decided you want to make CPF top-ups for yourself or your loved ones, the only thing left to answer is how you want to do it: in a lump sum, or making regular contributions monthly. This article explains the pros and cons of each approach, and why for most people who can, the monthly approach makes the most sense – financially and psychologically. Read Also: Here Are The Pros And Cons Of Making Voluntary CPF Top-Ups In 2020 How Interest On Your CPF Monies Calculated – And Credited To You Any discussion on CPF contributions frequency needs to take place in the context of how CPF interest is calculated and credited. The good news is that interest on our CPF monies is computed monthly. Top-ups and contributions will begin to earn us pro-rated interest from the next month onwards, while withdrawals and deductions will stop earning us interest from the month they are made. In simple terms, you can think of the amount of interest you will earn in a given month as being based on the lowest level of balances you have – since any new top-ups would only begin to earn interest the following month, and anything you withdraw would not earn interest for you. All the interest owed to us for a given year will be credited to our respective CPF accounts by 1 January the following year, which means our CPF monies compound annually. Read Also: Here’s How Our CPF Interest Rates Are Calculated – And Why Those Rates Are Almost Never What We Actually Earn Scenario #1: What Happens When You Make Monthly CPF Top-Ups As we can see from the previous section, any top-ups we make will begin to earn pro-rated interest for the year as soon as the following month. Any top-ups to our CPF made in January would earn 11 months of interest, and delaying that top-up till the end of the year would mean we’ll be missing out that interest. Here’s a simple illustration of the interest we’ll earn if we make $100 in top-ups a month to our CPF Retirement Account:   As you can see, you would be better off by $22, compared to someone who contributed the exact same amount in a lump sum at the end of the year. Of course, one might say that contributing a lump sum in January would be even better, which is true – if you had the money lying around. The main point is that the sooner you make top-ups, the sooner they can begin generating good, risk-free returns for you. The same logic applies to making CPF transfers from your CPF Ordinary Account to your Special Account/Retirement Account. Read Also: Retirement Sum Topping-Up Scheme (RSTU) VS CPF Voluntary Contributions: What’s The Difference? Scenario #2: Why You May Want To Wait And Make Lump Sum Top-Ups At The End Of The Year We’ve learnt that making top-ups (and transfers) as soon as you can make mathematical sense, but flexibility might be one reason why someone would wait till the end of year to make CPF top-ups. The additional cash buffer might be useful for many, and some would also like the benefit of knowing their income for the year and the total deductions they are eligible for to help them decide how much they would like to top-up to their CPF for tax relief benefits. In those cases, there might be some sense in waiting before committing to making the CPF top-ups, which we all know is irreversible. Read Also: 5 Reasons Why You Should Top-Up Your CPF Special Account During This Year-End Scenario #3: Making A Lump Sum Top-Up At The Beginning Of The Year Those who appreciate that the sooner you make your CPF top-up, the sooner your funds can begin generating returns for you, might wish to consider the third option if they have the cash on hand: To make CPF top-ups at the beginning of the year. While this approach would provide the greatest returns of the 3 scenarios, but would also be the least flexible, since CPF top-ups are one-way, and you would lose the ability to wait till the end of the year to evaluate how much you want to commit to your CPF (for tax relief or spare cash reasons).

      "– GIRO (monthly or yearly instruction) For those who want to make regular monthly contributions, you can use GIRO to automate this process, by completing and mailing in the Top Up Retirement Sum Using GIRO form to CPF Board, Robinson Road, P.O. Box 3060, Singapore 905060. Upon approval, GIRO deduction will begin on the 15th of every subsequent month. If the 15th falls on a non-working day (Saturday, Sunday or Public Holiday), deduction will be made on the next working day. You will need to ensure you maintain sufficient funds in your bank account for the deductions to go through successfully, since banks may charge an admin fee for unsuccessful deductions. If you wish to amend your GIRO instructions (such as changing the amount or frequency), you can complete and mail in the Top Up Retirement Sum Using GIRO form.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING Why CPF Needs To Review Interest Rates For Our Ordinary, Special, MediSave And Retirement Account The CPF Act only legislates a minimum interest of 2.5% on our CPF savings. by From time to time, we may read in the newspapers that the CPF accounts interest rates will be maintained. For example, the Straits Times recently carried the piece “4% interest floor rate on CPF Special, MediSave and Retirement accounts extended to end-2023 ”. For the layperson reading this, we may be confused – why are they telling us that the minimum interest rates that we are entitled to are being extended? What These Articles Are Actually Trying To Tell Us While some of the headlines could be clearer, such news articles are not wrong. In fact, they deliver an important message. According to the CPF Act, the CPF Board must declare a rate of interest which “is not less than 2.5% per annum”. This represents the legislated floor rate we receive on our Ordinary Account (OA). And the declarations are done through the local media. Read Also: What Would It Take For CPF Interest Rates To Increase Beyond 2.5% (For OA) And 4.0% (For SA and MA)  What About The Higher Interest Rates That We Earn On Our Special, MediSave And Retirement Accounts? The minimum 4.0% per annum earned on our Special Account, MediSave Account and Retirement Account savings is not mandated in the CPF Act. This is the same for the additional 1% we receive on the first $60,000 of our combined CPF balances (with up to $20,000 from Ordinary Account) as well as the extra additional 1% interest we receive on the first $30,000 after our Retirement Account is opened at age 55. Read Also: What Happens To Your CPF Monies After Transferring It To Your Retirement Account (RA) At Age 55? While the minimums for Special Account, MediSave Account and Retirement Account is not in the CPF Act, the CPF Act does state that the CPF Board “may declare different rates of interest for different part of the amount standing to the credit of a member in the Fund”. Nevertheless, we don’t expect the minimum interest rates for these CPF accounts to be suddenly removed either as the government has committed to them. These Are The Minimum Interest Rates – But We Can Also Receive More Than The Minimum For many of us, it may also feel like the interest rates we get today are the default rates. However, the CPF interest rates we receive on our CPF savings are not fixed. They are calculated based on a formula. Given the rising interest rates environment today, there’s also a good chance that CPF interest rates climb above the floor interest rates. Here’s how much the individual CPF accounts pay us:   Read Also: Here’s How Our CPF Interest Rates Are Calculated And Why Those Rates Are Almost Never What We Actually Earn The only reason we may think they are the default rates is that interest rates have been so low for such a long time that the formula constantly derives a lower return than the floor rates. For example, if we used the formula above to derive the Special Account and MediSave Account interest rates today, we should be earning 3.06%. As this is lower than the 4.0% floor interest rates that the government has committed to pay on our SA and MA balances, we continue to earn 4.0%.  Source: CPF Similarly, the Ordinary Account computation would have resulted in an interest return of 0.09% per annum. But we continue to receive the legislated minimum of 2.5% per annum. [Fictional scenario: The only downside to the floor rate is that our HDB Housing Loan would have been 0.1% more than the floor rate – offering us an attractive 0.19%. But we obviously should not view it that way.]  Source: CPF Obviously, there is an argument that banks are artificially suppressing their board rates for fixed deposits (by offering promotional rates) and savings accounts (by offering high-interest savings accounts), but this is for another article. Read Also: Why Are Banks’ Fixed Deposit (FD) Rates Not Increasing Despite Interest Rates Soaring We Have Earned Higher Interest Rates From CPF In The Past While we have earned the floor rates for a long time, it wasn’t always the case. As you can see from the table below, before 1999, we earned more than 4% on our Ordinary Account balances and over 5% on our Special Account balances. Going further back, we received up to 6.5% interest on our Ordinary Account balances in 1986.  Source: CPF Why Are Such Interest Rate Reviews Done And Announced? For the Ordinary Account, the legislated floor rate is 2.5%, and the CPF Board has a responsibility to declare the rate. However, the frequency of these declarations is not found in the CPF Act. For the Special Account, MediSave Account and Retirement Account, commonly referred to as SMRA, there is no legislated floor rate above the 2.5% level. Since 1 January 2008, the government pegged the interest rates on these accounts to instruments with similar risks – the  12-month average yield of the 10-year Singapore Government Securities plus 1%. At the same time, the government also committed to providing a floor rate of 4.0% on the SMRA accounts. This has been ongoing, and the reviews are meant to inform us that the floor rate will continue. In CPF’s latest announcement, the floor rate for the Special Account, MediSave Account and Retirement Account will be extended to 31 December 2023. Looking back, we can understand why the reviews and announcements may be important: From 1 October 2001 to 2008, the government had committed to the SMRA paying out 1.5% above the Ordinary Account. This was then changed to the current formula but with a similar 4.0% interest floor rate. From 1 July 1998 to 1 October 2001, the MediSave Account was not part of the government’s commitment to pay a floor rate of 4.0%. The government had only committed to paying an additional 1.5%, on top of the Ordinary Account interest, on our Special Account and Retirement Account. At the time, the only thing protecting our MediSave Account interest returns was the legislated minimum of 2.5% to be paid on our CPF savings.  Source: CPF Before that, between 1 July 1995 to 1 July 1998, the government commitment was to pay the Special Account and Retirement Account 1.25% above the Ordinary Account interest.  As you can see, the government commitments to different accounts can change too, and the announcements serve as timely updates on the CPF floor rates as well as the extension of the floor rates on our CPF accounts. The announcements for the interest rates reviews are delivered four times a year (quarterly), about two weeks before the new rates take effect.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INSURANCE [2020 Edition] Seniors’ Guide To Healthcare Schemes, Grants And Subsidies In Singapore Every dollar counts. by This article was previously published on 1 June 2018 and updated to reflect the latest changes to the various schemes, grants and subsidies at time of writing in 2020. Similar to many other developed nations, Singapore has been and continues to face an aging population. Put simply, our country’s population is getting older, and we have more older folks being supported by fewer number of younger people. While the natural replacement rate of a country is usually 2.1 babies per woman, the fertility rate in our country currently stands at just 1.14. This means moving forward, healthcare schemes, grants, and subsidies will become even more important, as Singaporeans combat the challenges brought about by our ageing population. The government has already put in place numerous schemes to support our seniors during their golden years. These schemes are administered by various government departments including the Ministry of Health, the Central Provident Fund Board (CPF Board) and HDB. One of the greatest challenges facing health and social care workers in Singapore is getting the right information to the right people. Though there are plenty of schemes, subsidies and grants available to the elderly in Singapore, many eligible seniors may not be utilising them because they are not even aware that they exist. You can do your part by understanding the various schemes, grants and subsidies that you can tap on to support yourself, or your aged loved ones, during their golden years. Find Out More: The various schemes, grants and subsidies can be grouped according to three groups. They are 1) Healthcare Subsidies, 2) MediShield Life and 3) Day-To-Day Senior Care Support. Healthcare Subsidies Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) Community Health Assist Scheme, better known as CHAS, enables Singapore Citizens from lower-to-middle-income households, as well as all Pioneers (aged 65 and above in 2014), to receive subsidies for medical and dental care at participating General Practitioners (GP) and dental clinics near their home. CHAS is a tiered subsidy scheme. This means lower-income families will enjoy higher subsidies. The subsidy tier depends on the average household monthly income per capita. If your household has no income, the subsidy tier will be tied to the annual value of your home, as assessed by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore. However, seniors who qualify for the Pioneer Generation Package will enjoy enhanced CHAS benefits, regardless of their household income. Here is the eligibility criteria for CHAS and the various subsidies that you receive.  Source: CHAS To apply, you can visit the CHAS website, or go to any public hospital, polyclinic, Community Centre (CC) or Community Development Council (CDC). You can find out more about CHAS on its website.   Pioneer Generation Package (PGP) Introduced in the Singapore Budget 2014, the Pioneer Generation Package (PGP) is a $8 billion healthcare fund for the Pioneer Generation, which consists of Singaporeans born in 1949, and who have obtained Singapore citizenship by 31 December 1986. In total, about 450,000 citizens qualify for the PGP which consists of 1) outpatient care subsidies, 2) MediShield Life premium subsidies 3) Medisave top-ups, and 4) disability income assistance  and 5) participation incentive for joining CareShield Life. – Special subsidies at CHAS GP and dental clinics. – Additional 50% off subsidised services and medication at polyclinics and specialist outpatient care in public hospitals. – Special premiums subsidies for MediShield Life premiums. – Annual Medisave top-ups ranging from $200 to $800 annually for life. Again, the top-ups are tiered which means the older you are, the more subsidies you get. – $100 each month for those who qualify for the pioneer generation disability assistance scheme. – Total of $4,000 participation incentive to join CareShield Life by 31 December 2023. This will be spread over ten years and used to offset their annual CareShield Life premiums. Qualification for the PGP is based purely on age and citizenship status. You can find out more about the PGP here.   Merdeka Generation Package The Merdeka Generation Package is for Singaporeans born from 1 January 1950 to 31 December 1959, and who became a Singapore Citizen on or before 31 December 1996. The package is also given to seniors who do not receive the Pioneer Generation Package, but were born on or before 31 December 1949, and became a Singapore Citizen on or before 31 December 1996 Intended to honour the generation who steered the nation during the nation’s growing years, the Merdeka Generation Package consists of 1) a one-off $100 PAssion Silver Card top-up, 2) MediSave top-ups, 3) Outpatient Care Subsidies, 4) participation incentive for joining CareShield Life and 5) Additional MediShield Life Premium Subsidies – One-off $100 PAssion Silver Card top-up which can be used for public transport, ActiveSG gym and pool entries, at Ezlink-accepted merchants and Active Aging Programmes. – $200 Medisave Top-Ups every year, from 2019 to 2023. – Additional 25% off remaining bill for subsidised services and medications at polyclinics and public specialist outpatient clinics (SOCs). A referral from polyclinic or CHAS clinic is required for subsidized rates at public SOCs. – Subsidised rates at CHAS clinics and $2 fixed fee for Recommended Health Screening\n",
      "through Screen for Life. – Total of $4,000 participation incentive to join CareShield Life. – Additional 5% subsidy for your annual premiums for MediShield Life, increasing to 10% after the age of 75. Read Also: Merdeka Generation Package 2019: Who’s Eligible And What Singaporeans Will Be Receiving Medisave Top-ups For Elderly Update: This has been replaced by the PGP and MGP. Singaporean seniors who do not fall under the Pioneer Generation will receive Medisave top-ups of $100 to $200 annually until 2018. Medisave can be used to pay for your personal or immediate family’s hospitalisation, day surgery and specific outpatient expenses in any hospital in Singapore. If you are already receiving GST Voucher – Cash or GST Voucher – Medisave, there is no need to sign up. Otherwise, you can apply through any Community Centre, Social Service Office (SSO), CPF Service Centre, or the GST Voucher website.   Flexi-Medisave Scheme Introduced in 2015, this scheme allows seniors, aged 65 and above, to use an additional $200 of their Medisave a year, for outpatient medical treatments at CHAS-registered public-sector specialist outpatient clinics (SOCs), GPs and polyclinics. Do note that the $200 of Flexi-Medisave can be used over and above other outpatient Medisave limits, such as the $400 annual limit for the Chronic Disease Management Programme, and the $300 limit for outpatient scans. You can read up more about the use of the Flexi-Medisave in this release from the Ministry of Health.   MediShield Life MediShield Life Premium Subsidies MediShield Life is a basic health insurance plan that pays for large hospital bills and specific outpatient treatments, and is extended to Singaporeans and PRs for life. The government subsidises all senior citizens’ MediShield Life Premiums by up to 50 per cent for lower- and middle-income households. For seniors who are unable to afford MediShield Life premiums even after the subsidies, additional support will be provided. No application is required for this, as the subsidies will be distributed based on existing information in the Government databases. To check or update your household information used to calculate your Premium Subsidies, you can check the Household Check e-Service.

Medifund assistance can be sought through consultation with medical social workers from Medifund-approved institutions. To be clear, Medifund Silver is a subset of Medifund, which is for the general population. It does not overlap the role of Medifund. Read Also: What Happens When You Can’t Pay For Your Hospitalisation Bills In Singapore?   Day-to-Day Senior Care Support While CHAS, the PGP and the various MediShield and Medisave subsidies and top-ups are well-discussed, many of the areas provided under the senior care support are less known.   Intermediate And Long Term Care (ILTC) Subsidies ILTC subsidies extend not just to seniors, but also to people who need further care and treatment after being discharged from the hospital as well as people who are frail and require day-to-day assistance. Support areas include the following. Home-Based Services: Home Medical Care; Home Nursing Care; Palliative Home Care; Meals-On-Wheel; Escort/Transport Services; Home Personal Care Centre-Based Services: Community Rehabilitation Services; Dementia Day Care Services; Social Day Care Services Residential ILTC Services: Community Hospitals; Chronic Sick Hospitals; Nursing Homes Inpatient Hospice Care: Sheltered Home For Ex-Mentally ill; Respite Care Getting such health and social care can be very expensive over the long term, and subsidies of up to 80% for home care and 75% for residential services (e.g. nursing homes), are in place to help offset these bills. To qualify for these subsidies, the main eligibility criteria are that 1) the person must be a Singapore citizens or Permanent Residents, 2) meet the admission criteria of the ILTC services required and 3) are receiving care from MOH-funded service providers. Once again, the subsidies are tiered according to monthly household income per person, and vary according to the type of care required. If you need more information on the subsidies available, please visit the MOH website.   Enhancement For Active Seniors (EASE) Offered by HDB, this scheme allows HDB owners who are 65 or above, or have a family member in the household who is 65 and above, to make their flats elder-friendly by installing useful items. These items include grab bars, slip-resistant bathroom floors and ramps. Those who are aged between 60 and 64 years and requires assistance for one or more of the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) are also eligible. These activities include washing/ bathing, dressing, feeding, toileting, mobility, and transferring. You can apply for EASE via HDB e-Services, through your phone with Mobile@HDB, or visit the HDB Branch that administers your estate. So, don’t miss out on such subsidies if you are already intending to install any of these items. Read Also: Guide To Government Subsidies For Slip-Resistant Tiles, Grab Bars & Ramps Under The HDB Enhancement For Active Seniors (EASE) Programme   Foreign Domestic Worker (FDW) Levy Concession Seniors who wish to hire a FDW, or for people who wish to hire a FDW to care for a family member staying with them, may be eligible for a lower levy rate of $60 per month. The qualifying age for the aged person is 67. This is only applicable for Singaporean seniors. If the senior is a Permanent Resident and you or your spouse is Singaporean, you may also apply for the levy concession. No application is required if you are the employer, as the concession will automatically apply to all seniors aged 67 and above. Alternatively, people with disabilities (PWD), certified by Singapore-registered doctor to require help with at least 1 activity of daily living (ADL), such as showering, feeding, dressing or toileting are also eligible for the concession. Application is required if you are hiring a FDW for your family member, or for PWD. If you hire the FDW to take care of a family member who needs permanent assistance with 3 or more ADLs, you may also qualify for the Home Caregiving Grant, a monthly grant of $200. For more details, please refer to AIC.   CareShield Life The launch of CareShield Life has been delayed to end-2020 instead of mid-2020 as announced earlier due to delays caused by COVID-19 measures. CareShield Life will replace the existing ElderShield and provides better coverage for those who require long term care in Singapore. It features 1) lifetime cash payouts, 2) increasing payouts over time, 3) subsidies that make it affordable and 4) premiums that are payable by MediSave. Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents born in 1980 or after are automatically covered under CareShield Life or will be enrolled when they reach the age of 30. Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents born in 1979 or earlier can choose to join CareShield Life from end-2021, if they are not severely disabled. You will be automatically enrolled if you are born between 1970 and 1979, are insured under the ElderShield 400 scheme, and are not severely disabled.   ElderShield Update: ElderShield will be replaced by CareShield Life for new cohorts born in 1980 and after, while those born in 1979 or earlier have the option to enrol in CareShield Life. ElderShield is a national insurance scheme that aims to provide basic insurance coverage to Singaporeans who are in need of long-term care support during their old age. Unlike Medishield Life, which is compulsory for all, ElderShield is an opt-out scheme. That means all Singaporeans and Permanent Residents (PRs) can choose to opt-out of the insurance scheme if they wish to. Under ElderShield 400, policyholders will receive a payout of $400 per month for a maximum of 72 months (6 years) if they are assessed to have “severe disability”. The criteria for severe disability are when a person cannot perform three out of six Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). Source: Ministry Of Health Read Also: Turning 40 This Year? Here’s What You Need To Know About ElderShield   Interim Disability Assistance Programme for the Elderly (IDAPE) Since ElderShield was only introduced in 2002, there could have been some citizens who may not have been eligible to join it – as they already exceeded the maximum entry age or have pre-existing disabilities. For these seniors, IDAPE will provide a cash payout of up to $250 a month for up to 6 years, should they meet the necessary criteria. The criteria to be met are similar to that of ElderShield. Coverage for IDAPE and ElderShield do not overlap. You are either eligible for one or the other, not both.   Seniors’ Mobility and Enabling Fund (SMF) The Seniors’ Mobility and Enabling Fund (SMF) provides holistic support for seniors to help them remain mobile and live independently. The fund provides financial support for cost items that fall within one of three categories. Assistive Devices: This refers to items that help an elderly person move around, such as walking sticks, wheelchairs and pushchairs. It also includes things that an elderly person may need at home, such as commodes, pressure relief cushions and hospital beds as well as spectacles and hearing aids. Transport: For seniors attending any day services at the Ministry of Health-funded Eldercare Centres, Dialysis Centres or Day Hospices can get subsidies for their transport costs. Home Healthcare Items: Frail seniors who can stay in nursing homes but choose to stay at home and be supported by home healthcare services in their community can get subsidies for the cost of catheters, milk supplements, thickeners, adult diapers, nasal tubing and wound dressings. There are different criteria in order to qualify for the various subsidies. You can get more information here. Read Also: Your Complete Guide To Healthcare Financing In Singapore The plethora of assistance programmes support Singapore’s seniors in enjoying dignified lives without putting burden of financial strain on families. However, as mentioned above, these schemes, grants and subsidies are only useful if the people who qualify for them actually know about it. You can do your part by keeping yourself well-informed, and to let your family members and friends who qualify for them know about it. Have we missed out some other programmes?

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING Want To Invest For Your Retirement But Are Afraid To Lose Money? Here’s How A Variable Annuity Plan Can Help A retirement plan that gives you a higher return when market does well, along with a ratchet feature that locks in gain once it’s earned.  by This article was written in collaboration with HSBC Life. All views expressed in this article are the independent opinion of DollarsAndSense.sg based on our research. DollarsAndSense.sg is not liable for any investment losses that may arise from any transactions and readers are encouraged to do their own due diligence. You can view our full editorial policy here. With the highest global average life expectancy at 84.8 years, it should come as no surprise that being able to retire comfortably is an important financial goal for many Singaporeans. At the same time, retirement planning can be daunting for many, particularly if you are not good in managing your investment. For example, if you had the bulk of your retirement portfolio invested into equities at the start of 2020, you would have suffered what can be considered as an emotional roller coaster ride thus far in 2020. Using the S&P 500 index as a reference point, a $1 million investment portfolio at the start of the year would now be worth about $690,000 as of 23 March 2020. And with interest rates dropping to historic low, investing in safe, government bonds for yield would not give you a good return either. While the decline in the financial markets in 2020 due to COVID-19 was an event that nobody could had anticipated, this is not the first recession that we have experienced. Past recessions including the 2000 dot-com bubble, the 2003 SARS Outbreak and the 2008 Global Financial Crisis have also caused stock market crashes in the past. If you were invested during these times, you would have seen your investment portfolio lose a sizeable chunk of its value. This leads to another question. While we know that it’s important to invest, and that we cannot avoid the volatile nature of the stock markets, how can we ensure that we continue to grow our retirement nest egg while not having to feel like we are constantly in a 360-degree roller coaster ride? #1 CPF LIFE Scheme In Singapore, our CPF savings form the foundation of our retirement income. As soon as we start work, we begin making CPF contributions, which earn guaranteed, risk-free interest of between 2.5% to 6%. Part of these funds are channeled into our Retirement Account, which is used to provide us with monthly CPF LIFE payouts during our retirement. The various CPF accounts help us to grow our retirement nest egg in a predictable, risk-free manner, without having to worry about the volatility in the stock market. At age 65, we also start receiving monthly lifelong payouts from CPF LIFE. #2 Investment Properties Another retirement planning instrument for Singaporeans is investment properties, which can be rented out for retirement income. Compared to the stock market, property prices tend to be less volatile in the short run. However, the value of your property can go down during poor market conditions and that unlike our CPF LIFE payouts, rental income is never guaranteed and may decline or even fall to zero if the rental market is weak. Property owners also incur additional costs for their investment properties such as property tax, monthly maintenance fees and agent fees. # 3 Variable Annuity Plan While utilising our CPF savings and buying an investment property are common ways many Singaporeans will consider as part of retirement planning, neither options allow us to have exposure to the equity markets. If we wish to participate in the growth of the equity markets to help build our retirement portfolio, without needing to be worried about the roller coaster rides that the equity markets will give us, we can consider purpose-built retirement planning products such as a variable annuity plan. HSBC Life Variable Annuity is an example of one such retirement instrument. It’s a single-premium monthly income plan that invests your money into the financial markets while guaranteeing your initial investment upon the end of the policy term. Investing While Protecting Their Downside With A Unique “Ratchet” Feature The HSBC Life Variable Annuity has a novel “ratchet” feature that helps policyholders lock in any gains earned during favourable market conditions on a monthly basis. How the “ratchet” feature works is that it locks-in the higher account value each month and becomes the Guaranteed Payout Base (GPB)*. This GPB does not adjust downwards even if markets were to fall subsequently. When the market goes up and the account value increases beyond the previous locked-in value, the “ratchet” feature will kick in again to lock-in the new (and higher) locked-in value.  Source: HSBC Life Variable Annuity Product Brochure As seen in the diagram above, the payout* can only go up and never go down as provided by the “ratchet” feature under this product. * You will get back at least 100% of the single premium paid in the form of the monthly payouts throughout the payout period selected provided there is no partial withdrawals made during the policy term and the policy is held until maturity.  Choose Your Own Accumulation & Payout Period As a variable annuity plan, you get to choose both your accumulation and payout periods. For example, after a one-time single premium investment (in US Dollars only), you can choose your preferred accumulation period of 10 years, 15 years or 20 years. You can also decide how long your monthly payout period will be: 10, 20 or 25 years. For example, a 40-year old who chooses a 20-year accumulation period can look forward to receiving monthly payouts from age 60 onwards for a period of 10 or 20 years.  Source: HSBC Life Variable Annuity Product Brochure It’s worth pointing out also that the “ratchet” feature continues to be in effect not just during your accumulation period, but also your payout period. This means that even after you start receiving your payouts, your payout can still increase if the market continues to perform well. However, it will never go down. The “Ratchet” Protects Your Investment While The Market Continues To Deliver You Returns The “ratchet” feature in the plan is incredibly important because it helps lock-in your gains and protect against downside risk. So, while investors get to participate in the upside of the equity markets, they are also protected from wild downward swings when it does happen, similar to what we are currently experiencing today because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  ^ Your capital is guaranteed only if you hold the policy to the end of the policy term and provided you have not made any partial withdrawals. In the unlikely event that the market falls throughout the policy term and never recovers from the day policyholder first invests, the policy will guarantee the capital invested and the policyholder will receive their initial capital back. Source: Product brochure, HSBC Life Variable Annuity With HSBC Life Variable Annuity, there are no surrender fees and you can make partial withdrawals if you need your funds earlier. Ideally though, you would want to leave your investment monies untouched to reap the full benefits from the plan. If you surrender your policy before maturity or make any partial withdrawal during the policy term, you will receive the prevailing account value, and not the Guaranteed Payout Base (GPB) amount. That said, investors should always invest in a product with a suitable investment time horizon, and to build their retirement nest egg steadily. The key advantage for HSBC Life Variable Annuity is that it allows you to participate in the growth of the financial markets, while still protecting your investments against inevitable market downturns. This could be a complementary solution to add into the retirement portfolio that you have carefully constructed especially if you have a long enough investment horizon. The HSBC Life Variable Annuity is also an Awarded Winner of the Insurance Asia Award 2020 – New Insurance Product of the Year.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING Here Are 5 Things Singaporeans In Their 50s Should Be Doing For A More Secure Retirement Put your retirement on a solid footing by taking these pro-active steps. by This article was contributed to us by Syfe, an MAS-licensed digital wealth manager. Your 50s is full of opportunities and new possibilities. You’ve enjoyed much of your peak earning years. After years of climbing the corporate ladder, you now have one eye on retiring. And while you may still have financial commitments like your children’s higher education or the tail end of your mortgage, you know that in a few years, these will all be behind you. In this pivotal decade, it is time to take planning for your golden years a lot more seriously. Your 30s and 40s may have been devoted to your marriage, children, career and other financial responsibilities, but your 50s should be when you strategise your savings, investments, and debt repayments for your own goals. A good way to start is by conducting a thorough assessment of your finances. Determine if you are still on track to reach your financial goals. Are there any issues that could undermine your future financial security? Many people in their late 40s and 50s still have about 10 to 20 years before retirement comes. That’s still time to grow your wealth further or make up for any shortfalls. #1 Review Of Your Current And Projected Savings With retirement on the horizon, start thinking about the lifestyle you want when you finally hang up those boots. Find out how much you’ll need to save to make that dream a reality. You can make use of online retirement calculators and check your retirement readiness score to see where you stand compared to other Singaporeans. If there’s a gap between your anticipated retirement income and the amount you need, consider making some adjustments now. A good place is to start saving at least 20% of your income and trimming expenses. The goal of a financially secure future must outweigh the satisfaction of spending today’s wealth. #2 Grow Excess Funds Using Risk-Appropriate Investments As life expectancy increases – the average Singaporean can expect to live till 85 or longer – saving alone won’t be not enough. If you want a comfortable retirement, you need to invest more of your savings. That’s because you risk losing money in real terms if you keep too much as cash. Singapore’s yearly inflation rate of around 2% already outpaces many savings accounts. Following the spate of interest rate cuts we have seen by local banks, the gap is likely to widen. As such, your cash savings should mainly be set aside as an emergency fund and any surplus should be invested. Investing more doesn’t mean investing into a hodgepodge of assets. Instead, proper diversification matters. A well-diversified portfolio contains a good mix of equities, bonds, real estate, and other assets. These should have exposure to different sectors and geographies. While important for any age, having the right asset allocation for your investment portfolio becomes ever more critical in this decade of your life. Two things will help you decide: your risk tolerance – how well you can stomach the value of your portfolio going up and down with the market – and your investment timeline i.e when you expect needing the money from your portfolio. #3 Give Your Investment Portfolio A Detailed Check-Up As you get older, it is likely that your appetite and need for investment risk may change. Re-assessing your risk tolerance ensures you continue to be exposed to the correct level of risk in your portfolio. Managing risk, especially drawdown risk, is what creates a smooth journey to retirement. As markets fluctuate, your portfolio may experience temporary losses. But what you don’t want is a catastrophic loss from which you never recover from. Remember, a 50% loss would need a 100% gain on the investment just to breakeven. One way is to consider investing in risk-managed portfolios. Syfe’s Global Portfolio is designed to shield you from significant losses when markets crash and be on the front foot when markets recover. In times of significant volatility, Syfe’s Automated Risk-managed Investing (ARI) strategy reduces investors’ exposure to equities while increasing the allocation to bonds. The adjustment is done to keep portfolio risk in line with investors’ risk tolerance. When mis-aligned, the tendency is for investors to panic when they see their portfolios in the red. That fear can drive investors to permanently exit their investments and flock to cash. This is one of the worst money traps to fall into in your 50s. You are not just missing subsequent rallies, but potentially losing out on another 10 to 15 years of solid returns in the market. Syfe’s Global Portfolio will not keep a conservative allocation permanently. The average equities allocation is about 60% for a moderate risk portfolio. When volatility starts to subside, the share of equities in the portfolio will increase again to benefit from the recovery.

At 55, a CPF Retirement Account will be created for you, and you can withdraw your savings from your Special and Ordinary Accounts after setting aside your retirement sum. If you don’t need the money now, consider withdrawing your CPF savings at a later date. That’s because your CPF savings can earn up to 6% interest per year after you turn 55. This outstrips the interest rates for savings accounts and even fixed deposits with the banks. Moreover, your risk is nearly zero. Used alongside your other investments, you’re essentially diversifying your risk exposure even further. And if your spouse is a homemaker, chances are that they may not have accumulated much CPF savings. To help boost their CPF monthly payouts, consider making a top-up to their Retirement Account using CPF or cash. The good thing about using cash is the personal tax reliefs of up to $7,000 you will enjoy. Want more tax savings? Top up your own CPF account too. You will also receive up to $7,000 in tax relief while earning more interest compared to leaving your cash in the bank. #5 Pay Down High-Interest Debt As you look through your finances, another item to work through this decade is paying down debt. Now is the time to pay off all major loans, from credit card balances to car loans and other obligations. In terms of priority, focus on paying off loans that have the highest interest rates. This also means that your mortgage (if still outstanding) should be the last debt you repay. Housing loans in Singapore typically have lower rates ranging from 1.5% to 2.6% per annum depending on whether you get your loan from a bank or HDB. Reducing your debt at this stage of life is important. Once you retire, the interest payments on outstanding loans can eat into your retirement income. This can create unnecessary stress and worse, make it more difficult for you to service your debt. Set The Foundation For Your Golden Years Today In this decade of your life, a comprehensive financial check-up is as important as a physical health examination. Understanding how much you have and how much more you need to achieve the future you want is the first step to financial security in your golden years. Many find that speaking with a trusted financial advisor can help. Moving forward on the money moves above will also shield you from any economic headwinds ahead. You don’t have to make drastic changes immediately. It’s okay to take small steps towards these goals, like increasing your monthly investment contribution by $500, or committing to invest any bonuses received. Your 50s may be a busy period, but taking the time to carefully assess your financial situation and investments will bring you closer to the retirement you are dreaming of.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING Retirement Planning: Chickens, Eggs, And Investing For Retirement In Singapore Here’s how our investment rate of returns affects how much we can withdraw during retirement. by This article was contributed to us by Gregory Van, CEO & Founding Partner at . Clients often tell us that they want to jumpstart their retirement planning and that they have a target amount in mind. That is only half the battle, or should we say beauty, of being invested. How we invest from retirement to death is critically important to sustaining our lifestyles, beating inflation, and improving our ability to live better. In Life, You Have Two “Chickens” One is the “Work Chicken” – this is you – your work, creativity and labour are translated into the money you make from your efforts. We call this “human capital”. The number of eggs the work chicken produces typically grows through your working life (as your salary increases), but will slow down as you reach retirement. Then you have your “Wealth Chicken” – the money you accumulate, save, inherit (if any), and invest. We can call this financial capital. The number of eggs it produces is relative to the size of the chicken (amount of capital accumulated) and the quality of the food you feed it (how you invest it). Both of these chickens produce eggs (money) at varying speeds throughout life and should cross paths at some point.  For the over-simplified example provided below of the very diligent investor, passive wealth income is expected to overtake work income at the age of 52.  Have an evidence-based retirement plan: investing only until retirement is the equivalent of killing your chickens and only being left with eggs Life expectancy is 85 years in Singapore and trending upwards every year. This is great news. But what this also means is that our money must last longer. Decumulation, the drawing down of financial capital, is a phase of life we often associate with retirement planning. This drawdown will likely happen at an increasing rate, keeping pace with inflation and unfortunately more healthcare costs, in order to maintain a standard of living. For example, if you are 65 and spending $60,000 per year ($5,000 a month), when you are 85, assuming an average of 2% inflation, you will need $89,156 per year to maintain the same quality of life. This makes the management of your “Wealth Chicken” extremely important through decumulation. You Have A Couple Of Options For Your “Wealth Chicken” 1) Kill the chicken, and store the eggs: No investment and put the money under your mattress, or in the bank, earning next to no interest. 2) Feed the chicken a little bit but with almost no risk: Leave your money in your CPF Ordinary Account, earning an interest of 2.5%, or in the CPF Special Account or Retirement Account, earning an interest of 4%, assuming the interest rates do not change. 3) Feed the chicken more but take on more risk: Invest your money in a moderate portfolio of globally diversified stocks and SGD-hedged bonds (we use 60% stocks and 40% bonds for this example) 4) Let the chicken run free-range in the hope of many golden eggs while taking on a greater level of risk: Invest your money in a globally diversified portfolio of 100% stocks Before we get into some statistics, you have to make a strategically crucial decision in trying to maximise your probability of success of not running out of money while not pinching your pennies beyond reason and still being able to live. 1. Select a reasonable rate of decumulation (or eating your eggs), taking inflation into account (your cash flow), 2. Decide on how much volatility you can tolerate (based on your own personality and behaviour), and 3. Understand the risk of running out of money. Now, let’s say you have $1 million at retirement and need it to last 30 years. We tested three different withdrawal rates – 5% ($50,000 per year), 4% ($40,000 per year), and 3% ($30,000 per year) – and adjusted these withdrawal amounts for inflation over time.  A withdrawal rate of 5% is aggressive, with the probability of a 100% stocks or balanced 60% stocks and 40% bonds investment portfolio lasting 30 years to be 65% to 70%. That being said, you are better off investing (and more aggressively) than not if you want any chance of success in sustaining this withdrawal rate for 30 years. There is no chance of success if left earning a guaranteed interest rate of 4%, or 2.5%. A portfolio of 100% stocks has a dramatically higher media median ending value at over $1.1 million.  By reducing withdrawals to 4%, it is clear that investing does bear some risk, but with a very high success rate of lasting 30 years, and a much more significant median ending value to pass on to your loved ones (over $2.2 million). Leaving money earning 2.5% p.a. or less will run out of money in under 30 years.  By reducing withdrawals to 3%, the chances of running out of money by investing are very low. The ending value to pass on to your loved ones is significant, at multiple times your initial capital. Represented differently, see below a graphical depiction of the disbursement of projected outcomes for the 4% withdrawal rate, followed by the simple median outcome of the five options presented for your Wealth Chicken.   Not investing, in the case of any withdrawal rate, is never the best option. Don’t kill your Wealth Chicken. .

This analysis is prepared by Endowus and is for informational purposes only. Endowus makes no claim to its accuracy. Investing in securities involves risk of loss. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. There is a misconception that by being “safer” the risk of running out of money is lower. This is not true. Investing better is crucially important to living better. This means staying broadly globally diversified, at the right risk tolerance based on your goals and behaviour, and at a low cost.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING $711 To $2,772 A Month: Here’s How Much You Need To Spend During Retirement In Singapore Today You may need to pay closer attention to your retirement plans to afford the retirement lifestyle you want. by Planning for retirement in Singapore can easily be overlooked. Between working some of the longest working hours in the world, shouldering financial stress to afford the high cost of daily living and finding time to be a little happier in life, there is precious little time to dedicate to retirement planning. Even for those who consider retirement planning, many of us may be (falsely) comforted by the retirement safety net that the government has already built for us – CPF LIFE. By taking a hefty chunk out of our monthly salary to put into our CPF accounts during our working years, we can receive CPF LIFE monthly payouts in our retirement, for as long as we live. Read Also: [Beginners’ Guide] Understanding CPF LIFE And Your Monthly Payouts When You Retire In Singapore For those who understand CPF LIFE, we may be acutely aware that it primary purpose is to provide a basic retirement income in retirement. Many of us may be currently leading a lifestyle in excess of “basic”, and to continue a similar lifestyle, have to build other sources of retirement income during our working years. For example, if we turn 65 this year, we can stand to receive $1,013 to $1,115 in monthly CPF LIFE payouts. *This is a broad estimation using the CPF LIFE estimator, for someone turning 55 today and opting for the Standard Plan, but with inputs for the Minimum Sum (now Full Retirement Sum) of $123,000 that was required in 2010. How Much Do We Need in Retirement Today? So, we know that someone who turns 65 this year will receive $1,115 a month in CPF LIFE payouts at the high end. But how much do we really need to spend in our retirement? Minimum Income Standard (MIS) In 2019, a team of researchers from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy (LKYSPP) conducted focus group discussions with over 100 participants from varied backgrounds to understand what a basic elderly household budget would look like. They found that  single elderly households require $1,379 a month, while coupled elderly households require $2,351 a month to meet their basic needs. This is higher than what saving even the Minimum Sum and going on the Standard Plan for CPF LIFE would provide today, at the higher end of the estimation. Read Also: CPF LIFE VS Retirement Sum Scheme: What’s The Difference? Note that this is a 2019 figure, and just applying the 20-year average MAS core inflation rate of 1.7% increases it to $1,402 a month and $2,391 a month for single and coupled elderly households respectively. Source: LKYSPP Retiree Household Expenditure Another way to look at how much those in retirement would need for their monthly expenses would be to dive into Singapore’s Report on the Household Expenditure Survey 2017/2018 that is compiled every five years. Apart from just giving us some statistics, the figures found in this report can also be extremely valuable as it is classified by housing-type, which can provide some indication on the standard of living we would like to achieve given the home-type we are currently living in or are accustomed to. In this survey, it was found that household members, in households comprising only non-working persons aged 65 and over, spent an average of $1,154 each month. Source: Report on the Household Expenditure Survey 2017/2018 Of course, these figures are again based on past data and need to be updated to reflect what someone retiring in 2020 may need to spend each month. Simplistically, this is what may be more representative in 2020. Extrapolated from Report on the Household Expenditure Survey 2017/2018 for 2020 figures On average, each retired person, living in a household comprising only non-working persons, would need to spend $1,194 per month. As we can see from the data, those who live in HDB flats spent less, with those in the smallest 1- & 2-Room HDB flat spending $711 each month. Even those living in 5-Room and Executive HDB flat spent less than what their estimated CPF LIFE payouts would be if they kept the Minimum Sum when they turned 55. On the other hand, those living in condominiums and landed properties spent more than double their counterparts living in HDB flats each month. Those living in condominiums and other private apartments also spent more than those living in landed properties. Are Our CPF LIFE Monthly Payouts Enough? From a numbers perspective, it looks like those living in HDB flats could have paid for their retirement lifestyle entirely from their CPF LIFE monthly payouts, if they had kept the Minimum Sum when they turned 55. They would have been receiving $1,115 and spending under that amount. In reality, the figures show a drastically different picture – with retirees drawing an average of only $361 from CPF LIFE (and CPF Retirement Sum Scheme).  Source: Report on the Household Expenditure Survey 2017/2018 It may be logical that those living in the smallest housing-types may not have been wealthy enough to build up the Minimum Sum to receive a monthly payout valued at $1,115. However, from the data, even those living in landed properties, with the highest CPF LIFE income, only received $867 each month. This is less than half of what they were spending each month. Of course, many of these people may have a much smaller CPF balances as contribution rates may have been lower because of their age. Nevertheless, we should also take heed that active management may be required for us to ensure our CPF LIFE payouts can afford a basic retirement living standard.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg RETIREMENT PLANNING “Circuit Breaker” Restrictions Bring Opportunities For Dry Runs In Retirement Planning & Financial Independence If your dream retirement revolved around sitting at home all day and cutting spending to the bare minimum, your might want to be careful what you wish for. by This article was first published by Investment Moats. We lived in an interesting time where our normal way of life is being challenged. To halt the progress of this Covid-19 virus, governments around the world are asking people to keep a safe distance, work from home. Certain non-essential businesses are closed down. As an individual who is interested in financial independence, financial security and retirement, it feels like Covid-19 may have a profound impact on how people feel about certain themes within the financial independence movement. This post hopes to give you something to think about. Work From Home is Simulating Your Ideal Life Many of us are forced to work from home, do split teams or go into office on alternate days. With work from home, it gives you the opportunity to test out how life would be if you are: – A freelancer working in a knowledge-based role\n",
      "– Semi-retirement lifestyle or a cruising retirement lifestyle\n",
      "– Working while your children and spouse are at home over a prolonged period\n",
      "– If you do not need to commute The reason why we aspire for financial independence is maybe because we wish: – To have optionality in life\n",
      "– Have more time\n",
      "– Be able to spend more time with family\n",
      "– Get away from toxic work culture\n",
      "– Spend time on our hobbies We can test a few of these things to varying degrees. We discussed a bit in our Financial Independence Telegram group about this. One individual is using this period to test out a life of working, exercising and see if this is really the ideal life. Another came to a conclusion retirement is boring. Most are trying to adjust to working from home while in close proximity to family. A few are adjusting to doing too much compared to when there is clear segregation of personal and working life. Reflect upon this period: – Is this a more balanced life for you?\n",
      "– Do you miss working in the office or seeing co-workers?\n",
      "– Were you able to focus on working a certain hours, then switch your brain off and do stuff you enjoy?\n",
      "– How big of a deal is not having to commute? Your idea about financial independence may be re-calibrated. Identifying How Lean Your Expenses Can Be… And is Still An Acceptable Living One of the key aspect about planning for your financial independence is answering the question of how much income you need. That is a function of how much your family and yourself need in terms of annual expense. I do advocate for people to look upon each expense line item as two component: – Essential expenses\n",
      "– Less Essential expenses It is always a debate what are essential and what is less essential. Spending only on essential expenses is basically close to survival mode living that is acceptable. You are not giving your family the best, just enough. You are also not going to the bare minimum. You would realize that it is not a question of whether vacation is essential or tuition is essential. For each expenses, there are different grade to this. For example, everyone feels that food is an essential expense. No. There are different grade of expenses. Fine-dining is one grade. Eating at restaurants is another grade. Kopi-tiam food is another. Cooking Maggie Mee and Steaming Buns at home is another. If you classify food into the minimally acceptable level and the extravagant one, then you may be able to split your expenses to essential and non-essential. During this period, you may be able to figure your essential expenses out better. Government is asking non-essential services to stop working from Tuesday onwards. You are restricted from traveling. Some of you might see your job turned temporary or might have lost your job. Almost everyone is going into maintanenance mode. If you pay attention to your expenses, you might be able to extrapolate and figure out your annual essential expenses. It would be best if majority of your transactions are recorded in credit cards and bank statements. At the end of April, – Take a look at how much you spend\n",
      "– Contrast that to how much you were spending previously\n",
      "– Reflect upon also your views about this quality of life Some of us find that our spending does not differ much. At most, we save on transportation cost. Some realise their expenses are lower. Folks come into planning with some outrageous income needs. This is a time to reflect if it is outrageous.

This COVID-19 crisis somewhat highlights how much slack we have in our way of living. Slack means having enough room to operate, enough to sustain some margins for error. This crisis highlights perhaps the downside of an efficient system: Businesses operate without excess cash holding. If your company has too much cash, activist shareholders will question why do you need so much cash. It is not doing anything and it brings down the company’s return on equity. Paycheck to paycheck. How much we earned, it is paid out or deployed through recurring payments to insurance companies, mortgage payments. Our savings are in the form of lock-in commitments that cannot be stopped. Retirement Planning for the bare minimum. This probably going to contrast against what I said in the previous section. Because our retirement needs are so much, we planned for just enough. No slack. When the economic situation do not work our way, we find it hard to react. The solution to all this is sensible saving for the rainy day and have enough buffers: – Save a healthy percentage of your income\n",
      "– Ensure you have an emergency amount of cash In personal finance, we preached about it, but it took me a while to realize that not many firms can take the kind of shock where there is almost zero revenue coming in. Fixed costs like labor and premises still need to be paid despite less business. Interest payments need to be paid as well. If your business is a low margin business, high fixed cost, it is hard to survive with not much revenues coming in. On a personal basis, low margin means high income but end up very little free cash flow after all the expenses. High fixed cost means a lot of expenses that you cannot reduce despite no work coming in. I think while having an emergency fund would be good, the way to visualize your cash and investments is someone like what I wrote in my article about managing the money of a freelancer. Imagine your cash and liquid investments queueing up in a conveyor belt. How long of an expense or income runway would you have? In exceptional times, you might need to liquidate your investments or to frantically find cash flow. That is a hard decision to make. But it is still a pretty good thing to have that option available. The equities and bond market can be illiquid in times like this (the individual bond market became real illiquid at certain points), but it is still more liquid than many other things. Selling a bond worth $1 previously for $0.80 is painful, but you still have $0.80 when you need. And you do not need to sell off all your bonds at one time. Often, there are virtues for turning more of your human capital into financial assets. The Last Word I am not some guru who is going to tell you how the world would be like in the future. But I think in a way, most people would feel more strongly about what they really like, and could not get access to during this time. In a way, this restrictive period also helps you amplify what you really enjoy and are being short-changed. I hope that some of my friends could see the light after a period where their lifestyle is re-calibrated and optimise their spending. However, experience tells me if this event is short lived, things will get back to normal. I think many companies will start rethinking their office optimization strategy. Not in the name of productivity but in cost. A lot of times companies do things not because it is the right thing but based on herd mentality. This might be good for you if got adjusted to work from home, working shorter hours during this restrictive period. There might be more work opportunities that opens up for you. On the other hand, you may not enjoy this so much that you will prefer to have a 9-5 job in the office. But at the same time, this period might make you realize that despite that, it is good to build up some financial security.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg CPF How To Secure A Million-Dollar Retirement In Spite Of COVID-19 Crisis Type Market Crashes A financial crisis should not be a barrier to your retirement adequacy. With the right moves, it can even be a boon. by This article was contributed to us by Loo Cheng Chuan. It was a night in July 2014 and I just reached my hotel in Tel Aviv, the capital of Israel, for a business trip. I was really tired and crashed in bed after a very long flight from Singapore. Suddenly, a very loud alarm sounded, and there was an announcement that rockets from Hamas (a para-military organisation hostile to Israel) were being fired towards the city in which our hotel was located. Everyone were to head to the bomb shelter located near the hotel lobby. I hurried to the bomb shelter and waited for over 30 minutes. Inside, we felt and heard nothing.  Eventually, the hotel staff came and told us it was all-clear and we could go back to our hotel rooms. I was grumbling non-stop on the way back that my precious sleep was disturbed by a false alarm. It was reported in the news the following day that the Israeli military had deployed the high-tech “Iron Dome” missile defence system against Hamas rockets with great success, and that everyone could continue to go on with our lives as usual. I thought: “Life as usual? Seriously? How can life go on as usual during wartime?” Yet, every Israeli living in Tel Aviv was taking the rocket attacks as a non-event. Life for them went on as usual, and no one was concerned. So, I went on with my business meetings, and when the day was over, I went back to the hotel for a jog at a nearby beach. Suddenly, there was a very loud explosion in the air. I looked up and saw a puff of smoke high up in the skies. Apparently, a pair of “Iron Dome” missiles had just shot down a Hamas rocket! I was shocked and quickly took my phone and photographed the scene before getting ready to run back to my hotel’s bomb shelter. However, every Israeli around me looked up in the skies and continued on with their lives, totally chill and relaxed. Diners outside restaurants continued with their meals, fellow joggers continued with their runs, and surfers in the water went on surfing.  All of them seem to have utmost trust that their “Iron Dome” defense system would shoot down every enemy rocket, so to them, there was no need to panic or worry.

In May 2019, I wrote an article titled “A Stock Market Crash Is Coming, Are You Ready For It?“. In it, I warned of an impending stock market crash, and suggested what everyone should be doing to prepare for such an event. Readers who heeded my advice would find themselves better equipped to handle the recent market crash. In the article, I reiterated the need to build the ultimate financial Iron-Dome: the 1M65 CPF safety net which you may also read about here and here. 1M65 – A “Financial Iron Dome” Against Stock Market Turmoil Over the past three weeks, the stock market had crashed to an unprecedented degree. Investors terrified by the COVID-19 crisis and its economic impact dumped their stocks with frightening speed in an attempt to cut losses. Even astute investors like Warren Buffet and Ray Dalio saw their portfolios crash significantly. Fortunately for me (and all CPF members), the CPF Special Account (SA) still compounds exponentially at 4% to 6% per annum. Young couples who heeded the 1M65 roadmap and ramped up their SA contributions over the years to $130,000 each, would be comforted knowing that no matter how badly stock market investments fare; how much property values dropped; or even if they end up being retrenched, their million-dollar retirements as a family is still secured thanks to their CPF. With the hope of inspiring more couples to strive for a multi-million dollar retirement, I am pleased to share that one of our 1M65 fans have created a 1M65 app (for free!) to help you forecast what your CPF savings would be at 65 years old. For those who are interested, more details are available in our 1M65 Telegram Channel.

For me, and many other savvy investors, this crash was a long-awaited fire sale for picking up equities on the low. Sadly, many others panicked-sold instead of buying low during the crash and are now staying far away from investing. Many investors have written to ask me what they should do. When I shared that I am buying during these crashes for the long-term, the common remarks would be: “What if the market goes down some more?” or “I will only buy when prices crash more”. From my experience of previous major stock market crashes, namely the Great Recession of 2008, the Europe Debt Crisis of 2012 and the China Stock Market Crash of 2015, investors who think like this miss out on stock market recoveries as they wait for the “best time” on the sidelines. I cannot predict when the market will bottom out, but the comfort of a 1M65 “Iron Dome” has given me the guts to buy on the crash amid uncertainty and panic in the market. 1M65 also helps me to sleep better at night during these turbulent times, knowing that my retirement is still secured financially. So, I would encourage you to first pursue a solid financial foundation based on 1M65, otherwise you would be living in fear of constantly “stock market rocket attacks” without the protection of a “financial Iron Dome” as a safety net.

My Personal Advice On Investing During Market Crashes By now you should realise that buying on market crashes requires emotional mastery more than intellectual skill. Given the COVID-19 uncertainty and imminent rise in death counts in the US, Europe and the rest of the world, I think that the worst of COVID-19 is far from over. I expect more volatility and market downs, and that’s why I would continue to spread-out my purchases as the market continues to tumble. In addition, it is not easy to go through it alone, given the unnerving emotional experience, but it helps to have a community of like-minded investors who can support and encourage one another to keep believing. Our 1M65 community on Telegram has many experienced investors who are more than happy to help out and play that important role.

Yet, having a 1M65 “Iron Dome” would give you the comfort that a million-dollar retirement is secured in your CPF. Finally, please practice social distancing and maintain the highest standard of hygiene. I believe that we will all go through this crisis and emerge wiser and stronger.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg RETIREMENT PLANNING Here’s How You Can Leave Behind A Financial Legacy For Your Loved Ones How to allow your achievements to last more than a lifetime. by This article was contributed to us by AIA Singapore. Most of us understand the need to live well by keeping ourselves healthy, active and engaged to enable us to care for and spend quality time with our loved ones for as long as possible. At the same time, thinking about leaving well, in order to protect your loved ones when you are no longer around, is equally important. According to Credit Suisse’s Global Wealth Report 2019, the average wealth per adult in Singapore is about US$297,873, or approximately S$400,000. This is a substantial amount of money for anyone to leave behind for their beneficiaries and it makes sense to plan ahead to ensure the wealth we leave is well distributed and our beneficiaries can make the most of it. What Is A Legacy? A legacy is what you leave behind, including your assets and possessions, to your beneficiaries to create a lasting connection to them. When planning the legacy you want to leave, you should also include clear instructions of how you want to divide your assets and how you wish for them to be used. When you pass on, you also leave behind memories and your values to the younger generation. This is why it is important that you live a meaningful life and impart the values that you prioritise by practicing them in your daily lives. Why Does Leaving A Legacy Matter? Similar to how the generation that came before left you a legacy you could build upon, the generation after you will be able to build upon what you leave them. The way you lead your life has a profound impact on those close to you. These are the values you believe in that will act as a compass for the next generation. You also spend your entire life building your estate and you don’t want to neglect distributing it to your beneficiaries in the manner you wish. This is especially important if you have young children or other family members who are relying on you for their livelihoods. While leaving a legacy is commonly associated with wealth and prized possessions, even those without vast wealth need to consider leaving a legacy that affords your beneficiaries a means to sustain their standard of living, when you are not around to provide for them. How To Leave Behind A Legacy For Your Future Generations? Leaving a financial legacy starts long before you enter the twilight years of your life. When you have children, you want to inculcate sound financial values in the next generation, including being prudent with your money and learning important money lessons early. You also need to safeguard your loved ones with a financial legacy that will enable them to continue their current standard of living and to pay for important big-ticket items before your children are able to start working after they finish schooling. This safety net should include a payout that takes care of your home loan and other outstanding personal debt, as well as tertiary education funds for your children. This highlights the importance of having adequate life insurance coverage for the amount they will need. This way, they are not forced to sell off the family home or other illiquid investments in order to continue paying for their daily lives. You can also tailor the distribution of your assets such that you can achieve two objectives: 1) leave the right assets to the right beneficiaries who will know how to manage those assets; and 2) use your life insurance payout to offset differences in the nominal value of how much you leave each beneficiary. For example, if you have a property worth $1 million and cash savings worth $500,000, a $1 million life insurance payout can be split between two beneficiaries, with one receiving the home and $250,000 from the life insurance payout, and the other receiving the cash savings ($500,000) and $750,000 from the life insurance payout. In total, each beneficiary receives $1.25 million, with the one who needs the home more urgently being left the particular asset. The same situation applies if you have a beneficiary managing a family business or investments in stocks or other private companies. Likewise, you should list down all your assets as well as valuable and emotionally significant personal belongings, and create a will to explicitly detail how you want to divide the estate between your beneficiaries. This becomes even more crucial in instances where you may wish to leave different aspects and amount of your assets to different family members or even organisations. Together with your will, you should make your CPF Nomination for your CPF monies as they do not comprise your estate when you pass on. If you fail to do this, CPF monies will be distributed according to the Interstate Succession Act or the Inheritance Certificate for Muslims, rather than how you intended in your will. You should also leave clear instructions pertaining to your end-of-life care, in the event you are incapacitated or unable to make these decisions on your own, via an Advance Medical Directive (AMD), as well as funeral arrangements. This is so your family members understand your wishes and do not bear the brunt of added pressure having making these decisions. You should also make a lasting power of attorney (LPA) to appoint the people you trust to act on your behalf, in decisions pertaining to your Personal Welfare and Property & Affairs, in the event you lose your mental capacity. Protecting Your Legacy Against The Risk Of Unexpected Medical Expenses You may need to consider protecting your legacy against costly medical treatments in Singapore. Understanding the importance of insurance can be key, and you should also consider adequate critical illness insurance that will give you a payout if you are diagnosed with a critical illness covered under the policy, without having to dip into your savings or liquidate assets which you may have already designated for your beneficiaries. To plug this gap, you can consider critical illness plans like the AIA Power Critical Cover to provide comprehensive coverage against 175 conditions, including 10 Pre-Early Benefit, 150 multi-stage critical illnesses and 15 special conditions.

      "DollarsAndSense.sg INVESTING 5 Key Financial Areas Of Focus That Singaporeans In Their 40s Need To Plan For Your 40s can be one of the most fruitful and exciting periods of life – and set you up for success in the decades to come. by This article was contributed to us by Syfe, an MAS-licensed digital wealth manager. Your 40s can be said to be a golden decade for most people. You have the double benefit of a formal education combined with actual working experience; you’ve had time to clear your student loans and are now at the peak of your earning potential; and yet you still have enough energy to pursue your goals. Indeed, there’s much to look forward to. And by making the right financial choices for this crucial period, you’ll be setting yourself up for success and security in your 40s and beyond. Here are 5 key decisions you need to make regarding your money. #1 Focus On Your Retirement Here are some pretty astonishing statistics. According to a Syfe poll, 60% of Singaporeans are not adequately prepared for retirement and 69% don’t believe they can retire comfortably. Far from being too late, your 40s are a critical time for growing your retirement nest egg. Your income is likely to be peaking, and you still have a good 20 years or so for your funds to compound. Just to illustrate, a 40-year old who invests just $800 a month and receives a return of 7% per annum would have grown their retirement nest egg to a respectable $626,434 by the time they retire at 65. If they had invested a little more at $1,180 a month (which is 20% of the median monthly salary of $5,900), they would have ended up with nearly a million dollars ($923,989) in the bank. Prioritising your retirement in your 40s can mean the difference between retiring comfortably and having to rely on your children or the government for financial support. Whatever your retirement goal, it pays to work towards that by saving and investing. #2 Live Within Your Means As your income grows, so too will your spending – if you’re not careful. Even if your co-worker moved into a swanky condo or upgraded to a sportcar, resist the pressure of keeping up with Joneses – especially if doing so will set you back from your retirement goals. To prevent lifestyle creep and to give you the cashflow you need to invest towards your retirement goals, you need to set and commit to a budget. A popular rule-of-thumb would be to save or invest 20% of your income, leaving 50% for necessities and 30% for non-essential spending like shopping trips and dining out. If you think you lack the discipline to stash cash away, you can automate your savings and investments to steadily your wealth month after month. #3 Maximise Your Income-Earning Potential As you know, are three aspects when it comes to building wealth: savings, income, and expenses. To fast-track your financial journey, you can increase your income even as you save more and spend less. Doing so would allow you to invest more, which then accelerates the compounding effect of your money. Apart from asking for a raise or negotiating a better salary package, starting a side hustle like a small online business or doing freelance work can increase your earnings significantly, though you need to ensure you still have enough time for activities and people you care about. Another way to boost your income is to create passive income streams. Investing in real estate investment trusts (REITs) and dividend stocks is a popular option among Singapore investors, since you only need to make an initial investment, after which you will start receiving regular dividend payouts without much work thereafter on your part. #4: Marie Kondo Your Portfolio In your 20s and 30s, you could have invested your money across a variety of investment types and accounts. With money in different investment accounts, it makes it hard to know exactly what’s in your portfolios and to keep tabs on your asset allocation. Some of these investments may no longer serve your purposes, or there could be scope for optimising costs or performance. Thus, doing decluttering and streamlining of your investments can be very powerful. For example, having more of your funds in one place can qualify you for lower fees, which means you get to keep more of your investment returns. For instance, Syfe charges just 0.4% per annum for investments over $100,000. #5 Protect Your Family Unexpected situations can derail the best-laid plans. Ensure you have adequate health and life insurance policies in place to protect your family financially. Part of protecting your family financially is to write a will. Who will inherit your home and other assets? Who will take guardianship of your children, should you pass on while they are still minors? Secure the commitment of legal guardians who you trust to fulfil this responsibility when you are no longer around. As the saying goes, prevention is better than cure. Taking care of your health is the best way you can protect your family. Eat a balanced diet, exercise more and go for regular health check-ups, no matter how much you dread going. Sticking To The Plan Building wealth and securing your family’s future is a marathon, not a sprint. These financial moves may not be fun, but getting them right sets the course for the next 40 or even 50 years of your life.

      "Plan on digibank - Supercharged by SGFinDex  If you’ve only got a minute:  Let’s be real – financial planning isn’t exactly the easiest thing to do. There is a lot to consider since your money is usually in a few different places and it’s hard to know exactly how you fare financially. Thankfully, you can always count on smart tools like the “Plan” tab on digibank to do most of the heavy lifting and simplify financial matters for you. Now supercharged by SGFinDex, planning your finances is about to get even easier. All your money in one place What is SGFinDex? In a nutshell, it’s a way for you to connect all your financial information from banks, CPF, HDB, and IRAS to get a consolidated view of your financial data conveniently.  Simply log in to your DBS digibank app and click on the “Plan” tab.  Next, connect to SGFinDex via SingPass and give your consent for the retrieval of your financial information. From there, it’s just a matter of selecting the bank accounts you wish to consolidate.  You won’t have to worry about the security of your data because SGFinDex is secured with SingPass, and you will have complete control over your personal financial information at all times. Forget the spreadsheets With digibank, you can pool all your financial information automatically and track all your finances (even those from other banks) with just a touch of a button. There’s no need for manual inputs, financial statements and remembering of numerous passwords. Planning for your financial future becomes truly effortless. More data, better insights Any bank can collect your financial information and connect your accounts together, however, it is what digibank does with the data you’ve provided that makes it one of the smartest financial planners today. Since its debut in April 2020, it has been using its money smarts to help over 2.2 million customers – and counting – with their financial planning and retirement goals. With your consolidated financial information, the “Plan” tab on digibank can analyse your financial data and offer you a clearer cashflow projection of your income, CPF monies, expenses, as well as your assets and liabilities to help you spot any potential money gaps you may face many years down the road.  It’ll also suggest smart ways for you to close those gaps so you won’t have to worry about money and focus on your goals. Whether you’re buying your first home, planning to start a family, or just dreaming of a sweet getaway – you can use the goal-setting feature to add any financial milestones in life. Smarter financial solutions Having a better understanding of your overall financial health allows you to protect your hard-earned money. Here’s how: 1. Save more than you spend For starters, you can start saving more by cutting back on your expenses. The easiest way to do that is to track your spending.  The app gives you insights on your expenses and calculates your expenditure based on different categories such as dining, transport and shopping, to name a few.  You can also add various categories to better cater to your spending patterns. Having reduced your expenditure, you can start building your emergency cash to at least 3 to 6 months of your monthly expenses. From there, the next step is to make your savings work harder for you. One of the easiest ways to do that is to set up a high-yield savings account – like the DBS Multiplier. It offers significantly higher interest rates compared to most ordinary savings accounts. 2. Beef up your protection plans Life can take unexpected turns, so you should always be prepared for a rainy day. Your health is of utmost importance so you’d want to ensure that you’re well protected should a medical crisis hit. Within the “Plan” tab, you can consolidate all your existing insurance plans from other providers to understand your protection coverage, and when your payouts (if any) will occur from your various policies. It takes into consideration what you currently have and provides unbiased insights and suggestions based on your income, dependants and cashflow needs, making sure all your bases are covered. 3. Get investment picks, customised to you Digibank can also find you the right investments to grow your money. Backed by DBS investment experts, simply answer a few questions and let the app do the rest by finding the right investments suited to your risk profile. For example, with a Regular Savings Plan like DBS Invest-Saver, you can start investing with a fixed sum every month. The fixed sum doesn’t have to be a large amount and can start from as little as $100. Over time, and with the power of compounding, you can expect to see financial gains like never before. This is DBS digibanking Securing your financial future is not just about working hard, it’s also about planning smart. With SGFinDex on digibank, you can now plan better.

      "Track your savings and spending with digibank  If you’ve only got a minute:   Track your spending on digibank Are you spending within your means, or more than what you get? Here’s how you can skip the manual calculations and paperwork, and get a neat summary of your spending habits: from how much you’re spending, to what you’re spending on.   Know your spending habits in 3 easy steps 1. Review your expenses for the month  The bar chart gives you an overview of your MIMO - money in (green) and money out (red). You’re on the right track if you have a positive net cashflow month on month (taller green bars than red), which also means you’re spending within your means. Tapping into either will then show you the breakdown of transactions within each category. 2. Compare your 6-month spending patterns For example, by selecting the “dining” tab, you will see a detailed breakdown of your dining expenses for the month selected. You will also be able to compare how much you spent on food over a 6-month average.  Check on month(s) with unusual spikes and look for categories where you spent more than usual to keep yourself in check. 3. Set a budget  Now that you’ve learnt more about your spending habits, the next step is to set a budget on how much you can spend. Scroll to the bottom and click on “Manage Budgets” to have better control over your expenses. Add your own transactions under specific categories that may not have been captured for more effective tracking. This way, you’d be able to monitor your progress and celebrate if you’re on track or have kept within your budget (small wins!). You can also choose to add your own entries by manually adding transactions to have a more accurate consolidation of your expenditure. Check how it compares to your “Money in”  Next step: Understand your money better with this equation  Ideally, you should aim for a positive net position every month. However, savings can be tough especially if you have larger financial commitments or expenses. So, when you can save, do it as every little bit goes a long way. Track your net position with digibank Using the “Plan and Invest” tab in digibank gives you a bird’s eye view of your Money In (coloured green) and Money Out (coloured red). Your green bars should be taller than the red bars to achieve positive net position otherwise, you’ll need to find ways to adjust, save more and spend less. Watch out for more tips ahead! Here’s how to get better at money: 1. Pay yourself first Whether it’s your allowance or salary, pay yourself first by setting aside some money for emergencies, no matter the amount.\n",

The same principle can be applied to your personal balance sheet. Let’s say you have $50,000 after subtracting your liabilities.

      "Cost of hiring a domestic helper in SG  If you’ve only got a minute:  To alleviate the load of daily chores and caregiving responsibilities, many households turn to foreign domestic helpers (DH). This is especially so for young parents who may not have other help and need to juggle both work and parenting duties. As of December 2023, Singapore has a total of 286,300 migrant domestic workers (MDW), according to Singapore's Ministry of Manpower (MOM)[i]. The percentage of households hiring domestic helpers in Singapore is the highest compared to  (Japan, Korea and Malaysia) at 15.4%, followed by Malaysia at 12.0%.[iii] While the decision to hire a DH brings a host of benefits, it also comes with financial implications. There are more costs and responsibilities to consider beyond just the monthly salary. Here are some key costs and considerations to keep in mind. One-time fees Average cost *You can avoid forking out the S$5,000 security bond if you buy an insurance policy for your DH. For more information, please refer to Recurring costs: Medical insurance, below.\n",
      "Source: MOM Recruitment agency fee A migrant domestic worker (also known as domestic helper) can be recruited through the help of a maid agency or hired independently without an agency (maid transfer). If you are hiring a DH for the first time, using an agency might be a good idea since they’re able to assign the right help according to your needs. They will also assist with paperwork and ensure that all legal requirements, such as work permits and contracts, are met. You can expect to pay between S$1,000 and S$3,000 of agency fees. Alternatively, you can consider a transfer helper to save some money. Transfer helpers tend to be less expensive because they involve hiring one who is already working in the country and seeking a new employer. In short, using an agency streamlines the hiring process, saving you time and effort in hiring a maid, but at a cost.  Security bond You must get a S$5,000 security bond (paid to MOM) for your DH (except for Malaysian helpers). It can be in the form of a banker’s or insurer’s guarantee. This bond is a binding pledge to pay the government if either you or your helper breaks the law or work permit conditions. For example, if you fail to fulfil your responsibilities such as providing proper accommodation, fair treatment and adhering to employment regulations, the bond may be forfeited and be used to compensate the maid for any damages or losses incurred. You will get this bond back at the end of your maid’s employment - after you cancel the work permit, did not breach any of the security bond conditions and your maid has returned home successfully. You can avoid forking out the S$5,000 security bond if you get medical insurance (MI) for your DH. (For more information, please refer to Recurring costs: Medical insurance, below.) Placement fee (maid loan) Most maid agencies have a component call placement fee - often calculated as the DH’s salary multiplied by a specified number of months - that the employer (you) has to cover first. Think of it as the fee your DH pays to the agency to work here, which she then repays (to you) over time. To illustrate, if your DH earns S$550 per month and the placement fee is for 5 months, the total maid loan amount would be S$2,750 (S$550 x 5 months). Placement fees are not considered as part of your expenses since you’ll receive the payment through deductions made from your DH’s salary in the initial months of employment . Work permit Work permit costs include both application and issuance, which cost S$35 each (S$70 in total). They are usually valid for 2 years. You will have to renew your DH’s work permit if it has expired. Settling-in Programme (SIP) The SIP is a mandatory 1-day orientation programme for all new/first-time MDWs at a fee of S$75 borne by you. The topics covered include: This is to help your new MDW adapt to living and working in Singapore, as well as to educate her on her rights, responsibilities, and home safety measures. Employer’s Orientation Programme (EOP) In addition, you must attend the EOP to better understand your role and responsibilities as an employer of a MDW (if you are hiring a MDW for the first time or have changed workers frequently).[iii] Classroom sessions cost S$35 to S$60 - 3-hour course duration - while online sessions - 1.5-hour course duration - cost S$35. This programme aims to help you better understand the dos and don’ts so that you can manage your MDW while ensuring compliance to reduce the risk of legal issues and potential penalties.  Recurring fees Recurring fees Average cost Recurring fees Average cost Salary The most significant cost to expect is your maid’s monthly salary and it can vary based on factors such as nationality, skills, experience, capabilities and competencies. As of December 2023, the monthly salary for a DH typically ranges from S$480 to S$700  (or more). This is an estimation of the least amount of money that can be expected each month when employing maids based on their nationality[iv]: Nationality Monthly wage You should expect to pay more than the minimum, particularly if your MDW has prior experience. In addition to the base monthly salary, you might want to include overtime pay for work beyond the standard hours, bonuses for good performance and/or annual salary increment for prolonged employment. A competitive pay structure can help motivate your MDW and retain her for a longer term, should the need arise.  6 monthly medical examinations (6MEs) It is mandatory to send your maid for 6MEs to screen for pregnancy and infectious diseases such as syphilis (VDRL), HIV and tuberculosis (TB). A basic 6ME costs around S$35 (VDRL and pregnancy) so you will have to set aside at least S$70 per year (2 visits). Should your maid decide to renew her contract (after 2 years), she will have to undergo additional tests (HIV and TB - S$80) and this will cost you around S$115 (S$80 + S$35). On top of the mandatory MEs, you are also responsible for covering occasional medical expenses such as common colds, flu, or dental issues. Medical insurance Besides medical expenses, you must provide your maid with personal accident and medical insurance coverage with an annual claim limit of at least S$60,000. A basic plan from DBS (Maid Protect II) will cost you S$425.20 yearly. You can choose to add on benefits such as Waiver of Counter Indemnity (from S$34.53) and Employer’s Liability (from S$17.45) depending on your needs, at additional costs . The policy will cover the issuance of the S$5,000 security bond to MOM on your behalf. In other words, this frees you from the need to pay the S$5,000 cash up front to MOM. You will only have to pay S$425.20 for the insurance policy every year. Living expenses Living under the same roof, your MDW is like an additional “family” member. You are responsible for covering her living expenses which include food and utilities (S$200 to S$300) and other miscellaneous costs such as transportation expense (S$100) - for tasks like grocery shopping. Government grants and subsidies There are several grants and subsidies available that can help reduce some costs. The levy rate[v] for MDWs is as follows: Type of levy Monthly rate Daily rate If you are eligible, you only have to pay concessionary rate of S$60 (savings of at least S$240 per month!). To qualify for the levy concession, you must live with any of the following eligible person (Singapore citizen - SC): Do note that each household is eligible for up to 2 MDW levy concessions, caring for 2 loved ones at any one time.  The HCG provides a monthly cash payout of up to S$400 to help you with multiple caregiving expenses (beyond maid hire) such as senior and caregiver support services in the community to transportation for medical appointments for loved ones with disabilities (3 or more ADLs). Per capital household monthly income HCG Monthly payout To be eligible, you must meet the following criteria:  Alternatives If the cost of hiring a MDW is beyond your budget, there are other options you can consider. For example, for household chores, you can consider hiring a part-time maid or engage a cleaning company. Both options offer one-time or periodic cleaning services (hourly rate) that can be more cost-effective than hiring a maid full-time. If you require assistance for young children, consider sending them to a daycare or hiring a part-time nanny. Likewise for elderly and loved ones with disabilities, a part-time caregiver might help cut some costs too. All in all While hiring a MDW is costly, the benefits they bring often outweigh the expense. For example, you get more free time for family and leisure activities, reduced stress from household chores, and improved caregiving support for children or elderly family members. Ultimately, the decision to hire a DH involves weighing the costs against the benefits and prioritising what matters most in achieving a balanced and fulfilling lifestyle. That said, it is crucial to assess your finances and determine your affordability before engaging one. Ready to start? Check out digibank to analyse your real-time financial health.

      "Steps to take if you have a special needs child  If you’ve only got a minute:  A great amount of personal responsibility goes into raising a child in a wholesome and loving environment. This goes beyond just investing time and finances and includes being physically, mentally, and emotionally present. While having a child with special needs is not what any parent expects, it does not take away the joys of parenthood. If you are such a parent, a little planning can go a long way in helping to smoothen the road ahead. Being prepared will help you remain calm in the event of additional commitments that arise along the way – financially, mentally, or otherwise.  What to expect if you’re expecting If you are expecting a child, congratulations! Regardless of whether you are a new parent or expecting another bundle of joy, the latest addition to your family will come with its own set of responsibilities and concerns. When it comes to mental and financial preparedness, it is important for both you and your spouse to communicate effectively and to be on the same page. As a baseline, aim to have at least 3 to 6 months’ worth of monthly expenses set aside as emergency cash savings. If you have other dependents, this should be adjusted up accordingly. For freelance or gig workers, the recommended emergency savings is 12 months or more. Having a comprehensive overview of your finances offers greater clarity in money management. To do so, sync your financial information from other banks, insurers, CDP, HDB, IRAS, and CPF with SGFinDex on the “Plan & Invest” tab in digibank. With that, you can better manage your budget and review your expenses – especially your discretionary spend constantly, to ensure a healthier cashflow. Find out more about: Plan on digibank – Supercharged by SGFinDex What to expect with a special needs child At the start of pregnancy, obstetricians offer antenatal (pre-birth) diagnostic screening tests for any chromosomal anomalies and inherited genes. This is especially encouraged for pregnant women over the age of 35. While this decision is entirely up to you, many parents choose to have these tests done as it gives them more time to prepare for any potential complications or just to have the assurance that all is well with their child. Depending on the diagnosis, some anomalies can be detected pre-birth, while others may only be diagnosed in early childhood. For example, chromosomal (e.g. Down Syndrome) and genetic (e.g. Thalassaemia) disorders can be tested for pre-birth, while others like Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or learning difficulties (e.g. dyslexia, dyscalculia) can be conclusively tested for only after birth. Planning ahead For any family with a special needs child, there are additional considerations to keep in mind while planning – not only for your child but for yourself too. On top of the regular health and milestone check-ups during pregnancy and birth, further testing may be needed if any anomalies surface. This will add on to the overall costs and must be included in your budgeting. In general, the more severe the disability, the more expensive the lifetime cost of raising your child. How your child’s condition will affect his/her daily life will give you an idea of how much physical, emotional, and financial support he/she will require over the years. Read more: How young parents can plan their finances Where to start Consult your doctor and find out pertinent information on what to expect based on the type of disability your child might face. Is it likely that extra physical or behavioural therapy is needed as your child grows up? What is the level of hands-on care that might be needed? You can start by writing down a list of expected expenses from birth until their targeted independence. These should include your regular gynaecologist visits, standard scans and examinations, pre-natal checks, the various delivery costs (i.e. natural birth vs Caesarean birth), and the cost of your hospital stay depending on type of ward and hospital, among others. Some additional foetal abnormality tests that you may consider are as follows. Test Purpose Estimated cost One-Stop Clinic for Assessment of Risk (OSCAR) test Identifies foetal abnormalities (especially Down Syndrome) $300-400 Oral Glucose Tolerance Test Identifies gestational diabetes $20-S$50 Non-Invasive Prenatal Tests (NIPT) Detects Down Syndrome by using the mother’s blood to get the baby’s DNA sample $1,200-1,400 Detailed foetal anomaly scan Checks for structural abnormalities within the foetus (including facial clefts, heart structure abnormalities, spine etc) $280 Bear in mind that depending on the level of support required, you or your spouse might need to reduce working hours or stay home fully to be with your child. A professionally trained carer or domestic helper may also be an option to help you lighten your load. In such a scenario, you will be looking at reduced income and elevated expenses. This makes having a comprehensive plan for budgeting even more vital. Over time, some of these expenses can go up or down depending on the eventual level of support, therapy, or intervention your child needs. If possible, it is prudent to increase your emergency cash buffer for this reason. In such cases, it is better to overbudget for your expenses and adjust downwards accordingly, rather than underbudget and be left scrambling to find extra cashflow should an upward adjustment be necessary. The MediSave Maternity Package under the Marriage and Parenthood Scheme  allows you to withdraw up to $900 for selected pre-delivery medical expenses and covers additional surgical and hospitalisation claims subject to a withdrawal limit.  Ongoing expenses As your child grows and develops, there will be other expenses to consider. An often overlooked one is the increase in travel costs due to travelling to and from therapy or activities. In addition, there may be additional medication and cost of support like physical or behavioural therapy, occupational therapy and/or assistive technology. These costs will vary significantly depending on whether you opt for public or private healthcare. When it comes to education, a variety of options are also available. Before the age of 7, you can enrol your child in programmes that offer educational support, such as the Early Intervention Programme for Infants & Children (EIPIC) and Development Support Program1 which will cost between $5 to $430 per month depending on the needs of your child, the centre you enrol in, and the government subsidies you are eligible for. For education at primary schools, there are mainstream schools which provide specialised support for children with mild special needs under the Ministry of Education (MOE), including having an Allied Educator (AE) to help your child in school and having access arrangements such as additional time during an exam for students who are deemed to need it. Alternatively, you can consider a Special Education (SPED2) school which may offer a specialised curriculum for your child. Fees for SPED schools are higher than that of a mainstream MOE school. As such, you should factor it into your budget where applicable. Another option to consider is to enrol your child in a vocational training institute. Here, they can learn work skills to prepare them for future employment. Most of these institutes also help to connect their graduates with potential employers. Remember to ask any organisations you speak with on the availability of subsidies or grants you can tap to reduce your expenses.  What to expect in the future For most parents, one of your aims for your child is to achieve independence – both financially and emotionally – in their adulthood. As an end-goal, you should strive for some form of employment for your child. This can help boost a person’s overall well-being and confidence through building a sense of fulfilment and ownership. Some children with disabilities can be completely independent in their adulthood, while others with more severe conditions may need lifelong care. Consider whether your child is fully or partially able to support him/herself when you are no longer around. Do you have family members who are willing and able to provide the level of care your child needs after you are gone? Or do you have to ensure arrangements are made for your child to be cared for in a special home when the time comes? Forward planning in these various aspects is vital so that your child will have the necessary support in place when you are no longer able to provide for him/her. Read more: Financial planning with a special needs child It takes a village The old adage, “it takes a village to raise a child”, is more relevant than ever for a family with a special needs member. Being plugged into a community will play a big part in providing necessary support from people who share common struggles, and even some who have overcome them. You can also consider volunteering with schools, homes or special needs organisations (e.g. Minds, AWWA, SPD) to increase your exposure and experience with caring for someone who needs higher levels of dependence. This will also be a fulfilling and enriching experience as you give back to the community. If you feel overwhelmed, speak to a professional counsellor to help in dealing with caregiver fatigue. Ensure that you and your partner plan downtimes for yourselves as well. After all, if you fall sick or burn out, you will be unable to provide the optimal level of care your child needs.

      "Financial planning with a special needs child  If you’ve only got a minute:  If you have ever taken a flight, you would have noticed that the pre-flight safety instructions in the event of a change in cabin pressure is to place the oxygen mask over your own face first, before assisting anyone else, even your own children or dependants. This seemingly counter-intuitive advice of “saving yourself” first can be applied to other areas of our lives, including looking after those who depend on us. While it sounds selfish, the reality is that if you do not ensure your own well-being, you will end up in no position to look after those who need you. Living with a special needs child and/or family member requires sacrifices in lifestyle and living arrangements for the entire family. This involves ensuring you have a sound financial plan, and charting out different options for your loved one in terms of education, vocation, and other pathways that might be applicable. While making these plans might keep you busy, you should not neglect “saving yourself” first. Planning for your own retirement is an act of love towards your child as it can relieve your child of the potential burden of having to support you financially, especially if medical costs crop up in your golden years. Read more: 3 reasons why saving for retirement is an act of love Be ready for the later years In terms of financial planning, you must set up a family budget and ensure that you have adequate emergency savings, in line with your plans for your child.

Preparing your child well for independence and adulthood will ultimately help them in finding suitable employment and the rest of their life ahead.

Read more: 4 types of insurance plans to boost your retirement income Life insurance Life insurance will provide a lump-sum payout as a death benefit. While it does not relieve the grief that comes with loss, it helps to defray any unexpected costs and provide a financial buffer for the family. Depending on your affordability and needs, you can select between a term and a whole life plan. A term plan has no cash value and usually costs less than a whole life plan for the same amount of sum assured. On the other hand, a whole life plan has a cash value. This means that if you surrender the policy at some point, you will be able to get back a portion of your total premiums paid or more, depending on the type of policy you hold and when you surrender it. Any amount you leave behind for your family will undoubtedly help them to live a more comfortable life, especially if you have a special needs child. Disability insurance Singaporeans aged 30 and over are automatically enrolled into the national severe disability scheme, CareShield Life. It is a long-term care insurance that offers cash payouts in the event of severe disability.1 The premiums for CareShield Life can be fully paid by your CPF MediSave savings. Depending on your needs, you can consider supplementary plans to CareShield Life. These plans offer higher monthly payouts to supplement the CareShield Life payouts, and often come with less restrictive criteria before making a claim. You can also look at income disability insurance that kicks in when you are unable to perform your occupational duties due to any form of disability. These typically offer up to 80% of your average monthly income, as a fixed monthly amount to relieve some stress due to income loss. Read more: Insurance needs for different life stages\n",

Left idle, the value of your hard-earned cash will be eroded by inflation over time. Investing can help to preserve and even grow the value of your funds. This will be especially helpful if you have a special needs family member who needs extra care financially, physically, and emotionally. Based on your financial circumstances, risk appetite, time horizon and financial goals, you can decide how best to allocate your funds. Bear in mind that risk and returns are inversely correlated – the higher the potential return of an investment, the higher the risk of potential loss as well. Low-risk investing options Singapore Government Securities like Treasury Bills, Singapore Government Bonds, and Singapore Savings Bonds are safe and stable options to consider. These range from a relatively short tenor (6 months) to longer ones (10 years). Alternatively, by placing Fixed Deposit (FD) in a bank, you can earn a higher interest than leaving cash in your everyday savings accounts. These deposits are covered under the Singapore Deposit Insurance Scheme (SDIC) up to $75,000 per bank. For more flexibility, you can place your funds in high yield savings accounts like DBS Multiplier. It offers you higher interest rates if you fulfil certain criteria like income crediting and having transactions in categories like credit card spending, home loan repayments, insurance or investments.

These offer the benefits of diversification through having a basket of underlying stocks. It is common for families with higher day-to-day expenses (e.g. from caring for a special needs loved one) to have a tighter cashflow, as well as less time to actively monitor any ongoing investments. In this case, 2 options you can consider are a regular savings plan (RSP) or a robo-advisor. DBS Invest-Saver is an RSP which enables you to start investing with smaller amounts (from $100 per month) through dollar-cost averaging – investing a fixed amount into the same investment at regular intervals. It also offers you some flexibility in choosing what to invest into from selected ETFs, unit trusts and DBS digiPortfolios. DBS digiPortfolio is a hybrid robo-advisor that allows you to invest into 4 ready-made portfolios starting from $100.

      "Learn more about: Ride the market steadily with Invest-Saver  Estate planning Having a sound estate plan will give you peace of mind knowing that your assets are handled in accordance with your wishes, and that you have done all you can to ensure your loved ones are taken care of when you are no longer around. Will and CPF nomination Having a valid will ensure that your family’s well-being is taken care of, especially if you have a special needs family member who may need more financial attention. It will circumvent any misinterpretation of your wishes after your demise and prevent unnecessary delays in the distribution of your assets. Any savings in your Central Provident Fund (CPF) cannot be distributed via the will. As such, you must set up your CPF nomination which can be easily done online on the CPF website. If you do not have a CPF nomination, your savings will be distributed according to Singapore’s intestacy laws (or Islamic inheritance law). If you have a child with special needs, you can choose to make your CPF nomination under the CPF Special Needs Savings Scheme (SNSS). This allows your CPF savings to be distributed to your nominated child each month instead of the standard lump-sum payment.3   Remember to keep your will updated regularly, especially if there have been any changes in your life stage or family situation. Read more about: The importance of a CPF nomination Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) An LPA is a legal document that enables a trusted nominee of your choosing to make decisions on your behalf in case you lose the mental capacity to do so. These decisions include your personal welfare, property, and financial affairs. Having an LPA in place provides the assurance that in the event you are mentally incapacitated, there will still be a trusted person to make pertinent decisions on your behalf for you and your loved ones. Read more: Why Lasting Power of Attorney is not just for the elderly Trust A trust is another means by which you can distribute your estate. It is a legal arrangement that allows an appointed trustee of your choice to administer and manage your assets for the benefit of your loved ones. As this is legally binding, your trustee has a legal obligation to keep or use your assets in accordance with the agreed instruction set out in the trust. While these are usually offered by professional trust firms and banks, there is also the non-profit trust firm Special Needs Trust Company (SNTC) which has been set up by the government. The fees for this are heavily subsidised by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), making trust services for special needs individuals affordable. For instance, the one-time set-up fee of $1,500 for a trust works out to just $150, after taking into account the 90% subsidy. The benefits of the SNTC2 are as follows. 1) The principal value of the trust fund is guaranteed by the government. 2) Regular reviews are conducted to check on your beneficiary’s well-being. 3) There are trained social work case managers to advise you in your planning for your beneficiary.  Put on your oxygen mask Planning for a family member with special needs can be overwhelming at times. Having to plan for yourself on top of that might seem like an additional burden, but at the end of the day every bit of work done now will count for peace of mind in the coming years. Remember to carve time out for both you and your spouse, even if it means requesting help in looking after your child every now and then, so that you do not experience burnout. Ready to start?

      "Teaching your child about money  If you’ve only got a minute:  Teaching your child about money matters from young can be one of your greatest gifts to them. Through simple everyday activities and leading by example, kids can learn the value of money and make responsible financial decisions as they progress through life. Here are 6 tips on how to educate your child on money matters. Categorised into two different age groups, you’ll find simple activities for pre-schoolers from 3 to 6 years old and school-going children from ages 7 to 12.  1. Teach the concept of money through simple daily activities Money knowledge can be learnt through engaging in simple daily activities. For pre-schoolers, consider bringing them along with you for grocery shopping trips. Explain to them that the items have to be paid for with money before leaving the shop. Allow them to hand the money over to the cashier, and receive change (if any) to increase their awareness. For school-going children, let them calculate the change they will get back after making payment for the items. Let them have a go at choosing from different brands of the same item and educate them on the importance of price comparison. This way, they can learn how to differentiate between selecting a cheaper brand and a higher-priced item with better quality.  2. Introduce good money-saving habits By instilling good money-saving habits for your children at an early age, you can foster a positive mindset where saving takes precedence over spending. For pre-schoolers, you can start by taking out the various denominations of notes and coins and teach them to learn and distinguish their respective values. You can also provide them with a small piggy bank where they can deposit loose coins from your purchases and start saving from an early age. As for school-going children, it is important to avoid overindulging their every request by buying them everything they ask for. Instead, you can help them understand that money is earned through work by assigning them simple chores like tidying their rooms, or sweeping the floor and then rewarding them for the completed task. In addition, you can consider showing your encouragement by matching their savings dollar for dollar. You can involve them in selecting their own piggy bank as an added form of motivation to save money from their daily allowance or other reward money (such as Ang Bao money from Chinese New Year red packets). Make it a point to explain that they can rely on their own savings to purchase items they desire instead of constantly asking from Daddy and Mummy.  3. Get a transparent piggy bank It is best to get a piggy bank that is transparent so that they can see the money increasing and be more motivated to save. This works for both pre-schoolers and school-going children. Besides have a piggy bank, you can also open a deposit account (POSB My Account for kids) for them online. Demonstrate how to deposit the money they saved from their piggy banks when they’re full.  4. Saving up Ang Bao money For pre-schoolers, you can instill a routine that involves entrusting their red packets to you for safekeeping. Take the opportunity to impart valuable skills by teaching them how to accurately count their Ang Bao money too. For older children, engage in open discussions about the significance of saving a substantial portion of their Ang Bao money. Encourage them to save all or most of it and explain the benefits of doing so. To deepen their understanding, you can take them to the bank where they can personally deposit the money, giving them a tangible connection to the process. Additionally, take the opportunity to educate them about the concept of interest and how it can help their savings grow. Demonstrate it by logging into their online bank account and highlighting the interest they have earned. Make this an annual affair as a way to help them realise how their finances have improved over the course of a year.  5. Open your kids’ first deposit account online To further aid in teaching them these important life lessons, you may want to consider opening a deposit account such as the POSB My Account for Kids. Not only can they deposit their gift money received during festive periods and birthdays, they also get a head start in building their savings. In addition, opening this account offers various benefits for your child. Rewards include a $1 gift deposit, sign up gift (during promotional periods) and waiver of coin deposit fee until he/she turns 16. There is also a complimentary POPULAR 1-year student membership. 6. Use the POSB Smart Buddy POSB Smart Buddy is the official partner for e-payment across all Singapore schools, and the world’s first in-school wearable tech savings and payment program. Not only can your child use the Smart buddy watch or card to make contactless payments in school and/or at selected merchants, it also lets them check on account balances, and track their fitness levels. Paired with a mobile app, you can allocate allowances, manage your child's finances on the go and set savings goals to track together. In addition, by linking you and your child’s bank account to the app, allowances can be debited within set limits and savings can be automatically transferred into his/her savings account.  If you and your child are existing users, you may want to level up their learning with the 5th Gen watch. It comes with enhanced features that can unlock better money habits. Find out more here. Starting the money conversation early and teaching basic money management skills can go a long way in your child’s life. It will be one of the best gifts from a parent. Ready to start?

      "How much do you need for your child's education?  If you’ve only got a minute:  When should you start planning for your child’s future? The quick answer is as soon as possible. Starting to save early and consistently will give you more time to accumulate your target funds, along with the effects of compounding.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re a new parent, you may question the need to plan for something that will likely take place only two decades later. However, it is crucial to anticipate that education expenses will continue to rise further. Here’s a look at the current tuition fees and related costs for an undergraduate education, both local and overseas. University location Estimated cost per year In Singapore public universities, a 4-year undergraduate program costs around $33,000 for Singapore Citizen students, and it does not include other miscellaneous fees. With demand rising, it’s safe to assume that fees are likely to increase further.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re thinking of sending your child to an overseas university in Australia, the UK or America, the fees charged by universities are higher, ranging from $18,000 to $74,000 per year. Additional expenses such as accommodation, living costs and flights can easily bring the total yearly expenses up to $100,000 or more.  How should you plan for your child’s future? Start by identifying the approximate amount required, and take note of how many years you need to save in order to reach that target. A Singapore-based student typically enters university around age 18 for females, and age 20 for males. Your savings target should include inflation rate, or the possible increase in fees over the two decades. Based on the average cost of $33,000 for a Singapore undergraduate education, with an annual inflation rate of 4%, the amount in 20 years’ time would stand at about $72,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a figure in mind, you can start working backwards to determine the amount you need to regularly set aside.  Investing in your child’s education Remain calm even if your expected savings fall short of the targeted amount. Besides embracing a frugal lifestyle, you may want to explore investment options to help you reach your target amount faster. Consider seeking professional advice by speaking to a wealth planning manager to receive guidance on your next possible steps. Alternatively, you may consider getting an endowment plan that aims to protect and grow your savings with fixed returns. Most of these plans provide the flexibility for you to select your desired payout age, to match with your child’s educational milestones. Such plans may allow you to pa y premiums over a set duration. At the end of the policy term, you will receive a lumpsum cash benefit in time for your child’s tertiary education. You may also consider opening a higher interest savings account like the DBS Multiplier, which rewards you with interest of up to 4.1% p.a. when you credit your salary and transact in one or more of the following categories: credit card/PayLah! retail spend, home loan instalment, insurance, and investments. Best of all, there’s no minimum credit card spend or salary credit required.\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of that, there are numerous investment products that you can consider to help grow your money. Depending on your investment profile/risk appetite, you can opt for unit trusts, bonds, equities or Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). Do bear in mind that investments carry risks. Do your due diligence or consider approaching a financial consultant. .\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, schedule regular reviews of your savings to ensure that you are on track. If required, make adjustments to your saving/spending habits or make appropriate changes to your plans if necessary. Sources\n",

      "Introducing your teen to use bank products smartly  If you’ve only got a minute:  Many of us probably have our parents to thank for opening our first savings account. Do you remember when it was that you took over the account to have it under your name? Or when was the first time you had your own debit card? Looking back, these might look like part of the growing up journey. But if you remember, they most likely felt like huge financial milestones as a teenager! If you have a teenager at home now, have you thought about what you can do to shape their financial future and help them develop a healthy relationship with their personal finances?  Savings account to appreciate the value of money Something as simple and plain vanilla as a savings account has the potential to teach your teen many important money management lessons. Here’s 2 of them: 1. Value of money\n",
      "When your teen reaches the age of 15 or 16, you may want to encourage them to take up a holiday job. The amount they earn can be put into their savings account. This is like an adult having to work to earn a salary. In this way, your teen can learn that money is hard to come by and learn to be more prudent on what they choose to spend on later. 2. Saving towards a goal\n",
      "A savings account allows your teen to keep track of how much time it takes to save a specific amount, thus teaching that it takes persistence and some delayed gratification to reach a bigger reward at the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, your teen may want to save up for a smartphone. By encouraging him/her to save their part-time job salary, your teen gets a sense of how many weeks (or months!) it takes to earn enough to pay for that long-desired item.\n",
      "\n",
      "This can have a huge impact in shaping their attitude towards savings in the future. Your teen’s first savings account would most likely have been a joint account with you. But now that they are a little older and possibly earning some pocket money, it could be the right time to switch them over to their own account. Here’s where opening My Account can be helpful. My Account is a deposits account that is available to customers of all ages. Imagine an account that grows with your teen throughout his/her life stages. As your teen grows, you can choose to unlock different banking service to suit his or her needs.  Digital wallets to manage their own expenditures One big money mistake that many of us made in our youth was… forgetting that small expenditures add up. Your teen is likely to be learning that same money lesson now. To help them manage their expenditures, register PayLah! for your teen so they can track their spending and learn how not to burn through their monthly allowance by the third week of the month. This also trains them to look at the bigger picture, which provides them a headstart in managing their personal finances when they become a full-fledged young adult.  Debit card to encourage spending within their means Debit cards are a great way to introduce your teen to the concept of budgets. That’s because when they pay with a debit card, the amount is pulled directly from the attached account. Because they can only spend the money that they have, teach them about budgeting by putting a small amount of money in the account at first. As they get more skilled, you can adjust the in-built daily spend and ATM withdrawal limits, until they’re able to handle larger amounts of money in their account. Another benefit of introducing the use of debit card is that many of them come with special benefits and discounts, which serves to introduce the privileges one can earn with credit cards, when used responsibly.  Transaction alerts as a spending and fraud checking tool Transaction alerts are another useful way to train your teen to spend mindfully. For instance, they can opt to be pinged for any local, overseas, or online transactions. If the alerts start coming in too quickly, that’s a signal for them to pause and be more purposeful in their spending. Another benefit of transaction alerts: it teaches your teen to detect fraudulent use of their cards, and call the bank about any transactions they didn’t make. With online shopping being the norm these days, this is an essential skillset. Conclusion It is never too early to teach your teen how to use bank products wisely and how to set aside money for a rainy day.

      "Growing your child’s savings  If you’ve only got a minute:  Raising a child, while fulfilling, can be an expensive affair. In most parts of the world, education bills can form a significant portion of the cost of bringing up a child. In Singapore, most children go through the public education system and the school fees up to Junior College is relatively affordable. While most children spend their time playing at the playground or studying for their next exam, they are likely not worrying about how they are going to pay for their tertiary education fees. However, most parents understand that university tuition fees demand a large sum of money. It is best to start saving early. Your children may not be working while they are studying but they will be able to accumulate some wealth over the years with their Ang Bao money, cash gifts from relatives and savings from their allowances. Rather than simply saving the money in a piggy bank, the money can be stashed elsewhere to earn better returns. Here are some ways you can grow your child’s savings!  Maximise the Child Development Account (CDA) and Baby Bonus 2 months before the estimated delivery date of your child, you can submit an application for your child to join the Baby Bonus Scheme which comprises a cash gift. There is a total cash gift of S$11,000 each for your 1st and 2nd birth and S$13,000 each for your 3rd and subsequent birth. It will be disbursed to you in various amounts until the child is 6.5 years old. Opening a CDA – a bank account that’s tied to the birth of your baby – with one of the three local banks will allow you to enjoy the CDA First Step Grant of S$5,000 from the government which is automatically credited after CDA opening. In addition, you will receive a dollar-for-dollar Government co-matching for each dollar you deposit in the CDA, up to the co-matching caps shown below. To maximise the grants given by the Government, you should top up your child’s CDA account up to these co-matching caps. Birth Order Maximum Government co-matching You can use the CDA monies to pay for educational and healthcare expenses for your child at Baby Bonus Approved Institutions (AIs). Post-Secondary Education Account (PSEA) Unused CDA savings are transferred to PSEA in the year when your child turns 13. In addition, any unused Edusave funds would also be transferred to the PSEA when your child turns 17. The PSEA balance earns interest that is pegged to the CPF Ordinary Account (CPF-OA) which is currently 2.5% per annum. If you have not saved up to the CDA contribution cap, you can continue to contribute to your child’s PSEA and receive the government’s matching grant until the contribution cap is reached or when your child turns 18 years old, whichever is earlier. The PSEA can be used to pay for account holder's or their siblings' approved institutions and programmes which include special education schools, ITEs, Polytechnics and Universities. It can also be used to repay government education loans and financial schemes. In the year that your child turns 31, any unused PSEA savings will be transferred to his or her CPF-OA. Open a savings account It is a good start to teach your children about the benefits of saving and the power of compound interest through a savings account. Make it a regular affair to visit a bank and deposit the savings and Ang Bao money your child has collected. This helps to create financial awareness and cultivate a saving mentality. With digital banking, it is easy to log in to show your child how their savings have grown over time. You can get started with POSB My Account, a deposit account that grows with your child. With the POSB Smart Buddy programme expanding to all primary and secondary schools by 2025, you will find it useful to link the account with your child’s Smart Buddy card/watch. This will allow you to instantly transfer allowance, manage your child’s finances and let your child develop a habit of saving money. As your child and banking needs grow, they will have the option to convert My Account to a Multiplier Account, that earns up to 4.1% p.a. in interest. Top up Central Provident Fund Special Account (CPF-SA) Parents can also consider topping up their children’s CPF SA with their Ang Bao money to provide them a head start in their retirement plan. The first S$60,000 of the combined CPF balances enjoys up to 5% annual interest. As the money cannot be withdrawn till your child is 55, he/she can leverage the long time horizon and take advantage of the power of compounding. If a CPF member is to make a cash top-up of S$500 to his SA every January for 20 years, he will have about S$15,500 in his SA after 20 years. This is based on 4% interest per year. Apply for the Singapore Savings Bonds (SSB) The SSB is a 10-year government bond with relatively low risk. If you are looking to build your child’s savings for their university education fees, the SSB is a good place to store their current savings as it provides higher interest rates than a savings account and being backed by the Singapore Government there is a very low chance of capital loss. The SSB also has an added benefit of being flexible as you can redeem the bond at any point in the 10-year duration and you will be paid back the principal and any accrued interest in the following month. You can also start with as little as $500 which makes it accessible to most.  Help your child to invest You can choose to set aside a portion of your child’s Ang Bao collection for investments, such as in a diversified portfolio of unit trusts or Exchange-traded funds (ETFs). If you are willing to take higher risk, this could allow your child’s savings to obtain potentially higher returns. One of the best ways to get started is DBS Bank’s digiPortfolio which offers ready-made diversified investment portfolios that are managed by the DBS Investment Team to grow your wealth. You can easily start with just S$/US$1,000. Another option is the DBS Invest Saver which offers a simple way to start investing through a Regular Saving Plan. With options of 4 ETFs and an extensive list of unit trusts, you have the flexibility to pick one that is suitable for your investment needs and risk profile. With a low minimum investment amount of S$100 a month, you can encourage your children to save more and invest in these funds on their own when they are older. And while investing, don’t forget to use the opportunity and share with your children about the benefits of investing and financial planning! Some parents prefer to park the savings in an endowment (savings) insurance policy which is earmarked to fund their children’s varsity education. Endowment plans allow you to save in a disciplined manner while providing some guaranteed returns. With a myriad of choices to help your child on his financial journey and grow his/her savings, now is the best time to get started! Ready to start?

      "Why open a savings account even if your child has CDA  If you’ve only got a minute:  Being a new parent can be a wonderful but overwhelming experience. Thanks to the Singapore government, every Singaporean child is provided with the Baby Bonus in their Child Development Account (CDA). While the account is useful in helping with certain child-related expenses for parents, good habits are best drilled into us at a young age and building the habit of saving is best started young as well. Here’s why you should also consider opening a separate savings account for your child.  What is the Baby Bonus and CDA To encourage and support Singaporeans in their decision to have more children, the Baby Bonus Scheme helps to lighten the financial costs of raising children. The scheme includes: Source: HeyBaby.sg1 What are the differences between CDA and Savings account for kids 1. Money in the CDA cannot be withdrawn Many parents would probably have opened a CDA to receive the Baby Bonus. While you may feel that CDA may suffice as a bank account for your child, the account has its limitations. For instance, you cannot withdraw the money from CDA. Instead, you can only use the account to pay for certain child-related expenses at appointed Baby Bonus-approved institutions, such as childcare centres, hospitals and optical shops. 2. CDA closes when your child turns 13 years old Another shortcoming of CDA as a savings account is that it will close when your child turns 13 years old. Any money left in the account will be transferred to the Post-Secondary Education Account (PSEA). So while the CDA is useful as a first account for your child to receive the government aid, it has its limits as a savings account as they grow up.  Why have a separate savings account for your child? There are 2 main reasons to open a savings account for your child: 1. You can withdraw money from a savings account Since the money in the CDA can’t be withdrawn, it’s always good to have a separate savings account for your child for other purposes.  For a start, you can save any cash gifts you receive from your relatives and friends to your child in the account. In the long term, this account can eventually grow with your child, so that he gets to use the money when he is older. 2. A savings account as their first money management tool A savings account can also be a helpful tool to teach children money management. For instance, your child can learn the importance of setting saving goals and how money grows by earning interest in a bank account.  You can also educate them on the value of money by giving them an opportunity to \"earn money\" through work. For example, you can encourage them by matching their savings dollar for dollar when they complete simple chores like tidying their rooms, or sweeping the floor. Through this, they will learn that it takes time, patience and effort to save for items on their wish list such as a bicycle or game console.

      "Forget about needing multiple savings accounts – this account allows your child to unlock key banking features as they grow! Furthermore, My Account is automatically bundled with your application for a CDA, making it a convenient process. 1. No minimum balance required Many deposit accounts require a minimum balance to start. When looking for a kids savings account, you’d want to look for one without a minimum balance, so that there will not be any fall below fees charged. Unless you intend to save a fixed amount into your child’s savings account, opening an account with fall-below fees can easily eat into the savings. 2. No minimum age Many savings account also impose a minimum age requirement, hence making them unsuitable for kids. 3. Child-friendly Having a savings account can be an abstract concept for a kid. After all, shouldn’t they be occupied by toys and storybooks? Therefore, it is important that you choose a child-friendly bank account for the little one.

Versatile To make saving more convenient, look for banking account that is versatile enough to see your child through childhood to teenage-hood – and beyond. For instance, a kids savings account that can be switched easily to an adult’s savings account removes the hassle of closing the account and opening a new one in the future. Or perhaps one where you get to keep the same account number after switching. And if you decide on My Account, it has the added feature of allowing the account holder to pick from a growing suite of services to suit his or her needs. It will require a little effort to teach your child about the usage of a savings account but it will pay off in the long run.

      "Young Parents: Planning for finances in the now and future  If you’ve only got a minute:  Having a child and starting a family is exciting and is likely one of the most rewarding things you will experience in your life. However, raising a child is no easy feat and costly to boot. For most new parents, focusing on the big picture can often be challenging, especially with all the newly minted parenthood responsibilities such as sleep deprivation and having to juggle between naps and feeding schedules. With the weight of a young family on our shoulders, it is vital to plan and prioritise our time and efforts to achieve the best outcome for our loved ones. More importantly, with milestones on the horizon, it is important to prepare for them while keeping finances in check and on track. Here are 5 tips to enhance your finances.  1. Get a good overview to stay afloat each month The simple rule of staying afloat: Your Money Out (i.e. transport, investments such as a Regular Savings Plan, transfer-outs, food, credit card payment, bills, insurance, etc) cannot be more than your Money In (i.e. salary, dividends, interest, transfer-ins). You will eventually end up in deficit if your total money out continuously exceeds your money in. This scenario will often lead to undesirable consequences such as a depletion of your hard-earned savings or your child’s education fund, over time. Therefore, it is crucial to note the things you shouldn’t be touching: A rainy day/emergency fund, your child’s education fund, and your retirement nest-egg. Advanced digital tools like the DBS digibank comes with a Money In & Out (MIMO) feature, which helps you keep track of money flows conveniently.  2. Scrutinise and cut unnecessary expenses Another feature of MIMO within digibank is that you can see how your money is spent in broad categories such as dining, bills, utilities, taxes, and transport, and if you are spending beyond your budget. You can also check on your financial ins and outs for the past 6 months to better understand your spending patterns.  Especially for busy parents, once you’re able to zoom in and assess how much you are spending and on which categories, it’s easier to plan/streamline expenses to balance your MIMO. Some areas of concern and possible solutions include: Why set a budget? By setting a budget, you’ll be able to achieve a positive MIMO each month, building up savings for your emergency fund, financial goals, and future planning such as protection (medical bills can be sky-high!) and investments to grow your money. This is something that simply living from paycheck to paycheck will not achieve. Once you can generate a positive balance every month (more money in than money out), you can then start to channel the amount into protection and investments to achieve your short, mid and long-term goals.  3. Do you have enough emergency savings? Money meant for your emergency fund is not simply savings — it’s not the money you’re saving up for your holiday, not the cash you’re stashing away for your next big-ticket purchase, and definitely not the money you’re keeping for your home renovation/ child’s education/ retirement. Neither is an emergency fund the cash value of your endowment fund, nor is it the total amount of your entire investment portfolio right now. That cash is illiquid, which means you cannot access it ASAP in times of urgent need. An emergency fund is, simply put, cold hard cash that you need for a rainy day, or when something unplanned yet urgent crops up. Here are some scenarios: This brings us to the next part - How much emergency savings should you have? To form your emergency fund, you need to set aside 3 to 6 months’ worth of monthly expenses. For example, if you spend $1,500 a month, you’ll need to set aside $4,500 to $9,000 (we recommend at least 3 months). If you’re a gig economy worker or freelancer, it’d be prudent to allocate 12 months’ worth of monthly expenses as your emergency fund. Instead of fiddling with your calculator or trying to recall your monthly household spend, simply login to your digibank - now supercharged by SGFinDex. Click on the “Plan” tab for an accurate view of your emergency savings by incorporating the cash deposits that you have with other banks. After accumulating enough for your emergency fund, you may consider the use of investments to grow your surplus savings (in excess of 3 to 6 months of emergency cash) to enhance your financial wellness. However, do note that investing always carries some risk (even if you have a hearty risk appetite). Do your due diligence and make informed choices. Not only does digibank offer a great summary of your emergency savings progress (via your MIMO patterns), it can project how long your emergency fund can last or alert you if it’s insufficient for your needs by spotting gaps while planning for both your child and your retirement.  4. Preparing for your child’s milestones and your retirement Once you’ve gotten your day-to-day finances sorted, it’s time to plan ahead and be financially prepared for your child’s milestones and your future. For your child, you may consider using an endowment plan that focuses on providing a lumpsum cash benefit when your child starts tertiary education, or a combination of insurance and investments into securities like unit trusts. As parents, we look forward to a future where our kids become adults and have children of their own. Retiring gives us the luxury to slow down and spend more precious family time with our loved ones and individual pursuits. But do you have enough for this desired retirement lifestyle? With digibank, enjoy the flexibility of reviewing your financial details on-the-go for an instantly updated cashflow projection during your golden years.  Taking all your assets and spending habits into consideration, the tool is able to provide clarity on your finances 10, 20, 30 or even 40 years ahead. By projecting them and identifying the shortfalls early, you will have time to close the gaps and work towards a comfortable retirement by actively making smart changes to your finances (save more, spend less, get protection, invest more). Furthermore, digibank allows you to set money goals for various milestones at various life stages, such as your kid(s)’ education. With each goal, the tool shows how it impacts your future cashflows and how far or close you are in your quest for financial freedom.  5. Don’t neglect protection – check your insurance coverage  In addition to helping you budget and grow your money, you can also use the app to check on your insurance coverage! While insurance provides protection for unfortunate events such as accidents and illness, adequate coverage can really help to offset big medical bills. Particularly for parents of young kids, it would be a nightmare if there’s not enough financial support to take care of their needs — present and future.

      "Managing money as a couple  If you’ve only got a minute:  There are many ways to manage your money with your significant other. Some prefer to keep their finances separate while others may choose to combine their finances, or it may be a combination of both. Regardless, having the “money talk” with your significant other is never easy especially when your relationship is just starting to get serious. Conflicts over money issues rank high among couples, so it makes sense to start talking about finances early. This Valentine’s Day, why not consider a gift that goes beyond the material and make financial planning a gesture of love? Skip the expensive gifts and take a moment to discuss your dreams, goals, and aspirations as a couple. Discussing financial goals as a couple can strengthen your relationship and help ensure you are on the same page when it comes to money matters. Whether it's saving for a dream vacation, buying a home, or planning for retirement, aligning your financial goals can contribute to a healthier and more secure future together. Here are 7 tips to help guide your “money talk” with your partner!  1. Understand that everyone views money differently Varying backgrounds and life experiences can shape individual attitudes toward finances. While you may see money as a means to enjoy the present (yolo!), your partner might prioritise saving for future stability. These disparities, if not addressed openly, may result in conflicts. Since everyone has a different view on money, it is important to have empathy when starting the ‘money talk’ with your partner. Recognise that your partner may be experiencing a different financial situation, and avoid jumping to conclusions, especially if, for example, they've maxed out his/her credit cards. Instead, consider working together to overcome such financial hurdles by setting achievable milestones and/or short-term financial goals like clearing all credit card debts. Don’t forget to take the time to celebrate the small achievements along the way. Doing so, creates a positive atmosphere and can contribute to a healthier and more supportive relationship. This is also a good time to align financial goals and find a common ground to proceed as a “team”. 2. Avoid financial infidelity We all know how important it is for couples to be truthful with each other; this includes your financial status as well. Avoid financial infidelity such as lying about debts or putting on a show of “wealth”. Such dishonesty can undermine the level of trust between a couple and can potentially lead to a breakdown in the relationship. After all, how sustainable is it to always be dining at high-end restaurants if your finances simply don’t allow for it? Trust between you and your partner is a two-way street. Having conversations about your financial past and journey can deepen your understanding of each other, shedding light on the reasons behind your money habits and beliefs. Remember, when it comes to money, communication is key.   3. Agree on how you’ll split the household bills As your lives intertwine, there would be more items to pay for such as household bills for your groceries, petrol and mortgage, amongst other things. Here are some common ways couples split their bills: In instances where incomes differ, especially if one of you earns much more or had experienced periods of unemployment, deciding on a fair approach to shared expenses can be challenging. If you’re the main provider (breadwinner), it may be difficult to strike a balance that feels fair and this can potentially lead to hidden feelings of resentment over time. Do work together to establish a system that considers the needs of both parties. With many joint expenses to pay, this is when a joint account could come in useful and while you are at it, you could get one that maximises the benefits for both of you. For instance, your partner and you could get your individual Multiplier accounts and credit your income into the joint account. This maximises your benefits as the Multiplier account will recognise the combined income and calculate interest based on this amount. You could get even higher interest rates when you buy groceries using a credit card, take a home loan, buy life insurance or invest through POSB/DBS. Read more:\n",

      "3 ways joint accounts work for couples 4. Be accountable to each other In most cases, there is no need for couples to be accountable to each other for all purchases as this could give rise to undue pressure. However, depending on the couple’s financial situation, it is advisable to set a threshold amount and give a heads up whenever a big-ticket item purchase goes beyond the pre-determined amount. Most importantly, you should discuss finances together regularly with your partner to ensure that both of you are on track to achieving the financial goals that you have jointly agreed on. 5. Plan for the worst Given the uncertainty in life, it is also important to plan for the worst especially if your partner or you belong to the sandwich generation. Ensure that you are adequately insured such that the family can carry on with their lifestyle even if you are no longer around. This means having insurance cover for hospitalisation, critical illness and death which cover the loss of future income so that your partner would not have to suffer financially in the event of an untimely demise.

      "Insurance needs for different life stages\n",
      "Insure to ease the squeeze At the same time, it is important to have emergency funds to help tide over any medical crisis that could occur or if one party loses his or her job.  The rule of thumb is to set aside at least 3 to 6 months of emergency savings to keep your lifestyle and investment plans on track. For those who are self-employed, it would be good to have at least 12 months of emergency cash. Read more: Making financial planning simple  6. Retirement planning For young couples, retirement may seem distant. Still, it is prudent to start discussing your retirement expectations early and review them regularly as it would provide you with a longer runway to accumulate wealth. Planning early (saving or investing) means you have more time and opportunities to grow your savings and make your money work harder. Furthermore, young couples have a longer investment horizon to reap the benefits of compounding and ride out market volatility, so they can afford not to be too conservative when investing. The key to successful investing is often summed up by the saying, \"Time in the market, not timing the market.\" By deciding on your desired retirement lifestyle, you can match them with multiple income flows from a diversified portfolio of savings and investment tools such as stocks, unit trusts, exchange-traded funds, bonds and real estate.

Share openly about caring for your parents Your partner and you may have different views on financial support for your parents due to the difference in upbringing. Your parents might also expect you to provide for them during their retirement or have made their own plans. However, with rising costs, the reality is likely to fall somewhere in-between. It is important to openly communicate with your partner about the expectations that your parents have of you and what you are committed to. Conflicts can arise as one set of parents could demand more from their child than the other and hence, mutual understanding and compromise should be reached by the couple on how they would like to take care of their parents together.  Single income couples For families with a sole breadwinner, it is even more important to maintain an adequate emergency fund to withstand unexpected financial shocks.

      "Financial impact of a divorce in SG  If you’ve only got a minute:  Data from the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) showed that a bigger percentage of married couples here are breaking up. Marital break-ups were also reported elsewhere around the world, particularly in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Stress from having to juggle both career advancement and family needs from the common dual-income family, caring for young children and perhaps the financial and emotional stress of being the sandwich generation could have also impacted the length of marriage. Getting through a divorce can be tough and not just emotionally. Many worry about the financial impact on their lives following a divorce. Some of the top concerns include how matrimonial assets will be divided, cost of the divorce and the provision of maintenance fees for their spouse and children. While all this can feel overwhelming, arming yourself with knowledge and preparation can help you to protect your assets and start a new chapter of your life on the right foot. Here is a brief overview of common financial issues involved in a divorce in Singapore: Cost of a divorce In Singapore, the cost involved in a divorce depends on whether it is amicable or a contested divorce. Simplified uncontested divorces are generally more straightforward and cost from $1,500 to $3,500. Contested divorce, where spouses are contesting for at least one term of the divorce, comes at a higher cost ranging between $10,000 and $35,000. Please note that all fees stated are estimates and will vary among different law firms. Division of matrimonial assets The division of matrimonial assets during a divorce is often a hotly contested issue since it can have a long-term impact on one’s standard of living. In Singapore, matrimonial assets include: Some examples of matrimonial assets include the family car, matrimonial home, savings, cash balance in the couple’s Central Provident Fund (CPF) accounts, businesses, inheritances and jewellery. Many people have the perception that splitting matrimonial assets means a straightforward split of 50-50 between the couple, but this is unlikely. Here are some of the many factors for the court to consider: As there is no standard approach to this matter, such situations are usually determined on a case-by-case basis. To protect your assets, it is prudent to keep track of major matrimonial assets and your contributions to them. For instance, if you are the one paying for your child’s preschool fees, producing bank statements of the monthly deductions from your account will help to show your part of the contribution to the family.  Matrimonial home The matrimonial home probably forms the largest part of you and your partner’s assets. Depending on whether it is a HDB or private property, couples have a few ways to divide the matrimonial home. If both parties agree, you or your partner can transfer either’s interest in the flat to the other, or sell the flat/apartment and have the proceeds divided in a certain proportion. Again, it is key to have proof of your contribution, so using CPF savings in this case is probably the best way. If you have paid for any home renovations, keep the receipts as proof of your financial contributions to the matrimonial home. Do take note that the matrimonial home will need to fulfil the criteria under what is considered a matrimonial asset. For example, if the property is acquired before marriage as a gift from a family member or inherited from one spouse’s mother after passing on, it may not constitute as a matrimonial asset. If you have been assigned to retain the HDB flat, you’d also need to fulfil HDB’s eligibility conditions to keep it. You will have to fall within one of these 2 situations: Situation 1: You have care and control of your children and have the financial capability to take on the home loan for the flat. Situation 2: You are eligible under the Single Singapore Citizen Scheme.  Spousal and child maintenance fees In Singapore, the right for maintenance is found within the Women’s Charter. Previously, maintenance is only given to the wife but in recent years, changes have been made to include a narrow exception for husbands who are unable to support themselves because of a disability. The court will look at the facts and determine whether the party seeking maintenance has such a need, as well as the appropriate amount of maintenance. A potential area of dispute in spousal maintenance stems from what is considered “reasonable expenses”. In the same vein, child maintenance will have to be paid because every parent is under a legal duty to maintain their child until he or she turns age 21. You can apply for child maintenance from your spouse if you are the legal guardian or has custody of the child. There is no set formula for determining how much spousal or child maintenance should be paid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some factors that the court will consider, include: An important tip for those seeking spousal maintenance is that you should always push for at least a nominal maintenance fee. This ensures that you still have an option of applying for an increase in maintenance in the future, should the need arise. If the judge does not grant any maintenance at all, there will be no possibility of obtaining maintenance subsequently. While nobody goes into a marriage expecting to go separate ways, divorce may be a necessary evil when the marriage cannot be saved. With our finances entangled within the marriage, it can cause a real financial impact if the marriage must be dissolved. Because of the emotional aspect of a divorce, it is better to end amicably rather than drag out the process and prolong the hurt for all involved parties (as well as for your wallet). Arming yourself with the knowledge of how a divorce can impact you financially can help you make the right decisions to accelerate the process and hopefully reduce the emotional and financial pain for everyone.

      "5 tips for single parents If you’ve only got a minute: Parenting. This is arguably the most significant job description in the world. Unlike a career search, the journey of parenting does not come with interviews and onboarding processes. Circumstances are often not chosen but given. And single parents may find themselves facing immense stress in daily life. Here are 5 tips that may help. 1. Find a supportive community Parenting can be a challenge, and asking for a helping hand when your schedule gets crazy is perfectly normal. Friends and family who step up with offers to help with child-raising duties can make a real difference to your sanity, and you should never feel guilty for saying “yes, thank you” to the offers. In this age of blogs, forums and social media, it’s easier than ever to tap into online parenting communities for information on child raising matters. People who have previously encountered similar situations are typically eager to share their experience and knowledge on topics ranging from school admission, healthcare access and even housing needs. Check out these parenthood-centric sites: mummysg.com, singaporemotherhood.com and heybaby.sg.  2. Work out your finances It is crucial that you work out your finances and budget for your family’s needs by prioritising them over wants. Some ways you can shop more prudently and reduce daily expenses include opting for house brands at supermarkets and purchasing non-perishable items such as toiletries and diapers in bulk when there is a significant discount. Take easy measures such as going over your subscriptions (gym membership, Netflix or Spotify subscriptions) and discontinue those you don’t need anymore. You can also cut excess spending by taking public transport instead of owning a car, have more home-cooked meals and select government education centres/childcare instead of private ones. With proper planning, it can be possible to lead the lifestyle you desire. Find out more Find a job that meets your needs, allowing you to balance work and parenting duties. Some companies offer comprehensive childcare benefits, with affiliated child-care services near the office to allow you to concentrate on work whilst knowing your little one is well taken care of. Voice out your concerns to your (current or potential) employer if needed and tap on employee benefits such as the flexibility to work from home, childcare allowances or medical claims.  3. Tap on financial subsidies There are numerous schemes available for single parents and it pays to spend some time and effort to check if you or your child are eligible for them. For example, the Baby Bonus Scheme offers Child Development Account (CDA) benefits of up to $11,000 each for your first and second child. CDA benefits include CDA First Step Grant and dollar-for-dollar matching contributions to the CDA until your child turns 12. This money can then be used for your child’s expenses at Baby Bonus Approved Institutions like childcare centres, kindergartens, hospitals, pharmacies and more. Here are some subsidies and policies you can consider applying for: This list is by no means exhaustive, but a starting point for possible avenues of assistance.  4. Invest and secure your future You may be working and saving hard for you and your little one, but with a projected core inflation rate between 3.5 to 4.5% by the Monetary Authority Singapore (MAS), your savings will need to work harder. You may wish to protect your savings against inflation with effective and shrewd financial planning. Consider starting wealth accumulation plans such as SavvySpring and ReadyBuilder that provides protection while allowing you to save regularly for your child’s higher education. Investments tend to offer returns higher than inflation rates. There are simple investment programmes that can help and guide new investors. For example, Invest-Saver allows you to jumpstart your investment journey from as little as $100/month. Find out more 5. Make time and space for yourself While the needs of your child are important, it is also crucial to carve out some space and me-time for yourself. It is hard to be a good parent if you feel constantly stressed and on-the-edge, so learn to recognise any warning signs that your mental and emotional states are reaching a breaking point. Speaking with certified counsellors or tapping on support groups may help. The Ministry of Social and Family Development and the Community Development Council also offer assistance. You may be a single parent, but you are not alone in this journey. Having confidence in yourself is half the battle won. Let your children inspire you as much as you are an inspiration to them.

      "3 ways joint accounts work for couples  If you’ve only got a minute:  What is the best way to manage your finances? It's challenging enough to do this alone; and with your spouse, there are so many more factors to consider! That’s because your decisions on how you spend your time and money will now impact others, and the impact lasts. One of the best ways to begin this new chapter of life is with a DBS joint account where both of you credit your salaries and dividends. But to really maximise your joint account in Singapore, you’ll want to ensure it earns the highest interest rates and rewards you for planning your finances as a new family unit. This combination comes in handy: a joint account with individual DBS Multiplier Account for each of you. Building a life together involves a myriad of spending and savings choices. And the DBS Multiplier helps you take advantage of these choices, letting you unlock interest from paying your utility bills, charging to your DBS credit card to buy the anniversary gift, or in time to come, paying for the kid's tuition fees.  What is a joint account? A joint account is similar to a savings account that you may already have on your own – but with at least 2 people having access to it. This type of account allows you to combine forces into growing your savings a little faster than you would on your own. Find out more about: DBS Joint Account Advantages and disadvantages of joint accounts There are many other advantages to joint accounts. It helps with budgeting and reduces the hassle of transferring money to your spouse for household bills. A joint account also allows both parties to have an overview of the family’s financial health. You can even open a joint account before marriage! This provides the transparency that can help couples build trust. Are there disadvantages? Some couples prefer to keep their finances separate and cite privacy as one reason. Another concern is that the joint account may have to be unravelled if your relationship status changes. But what happens to a joint account in Singapore when someone dies? In the event of death, the joint account balance will typically be passed to the surviving owner. Joint account vs. Joint-alternate account When applying, you'll have to choose between a \"Joint account\" and \"Joint-alternate account\". The difference is that with a \"joint account\", all account holders must agree to all transactions. On  the other hand, a \"joint-alternate account\" allows you to perform transactions independently and you do not need consent from the other account holders. (It's probably polite to let them know though, to build trust and transparency!)  Benefits of a joint account + Multiplier account Here are some tips to help you get more benefits by combining the use of a joint account together with a personal Multiplier Account 1. Earn higher interest by \"stacking\" your salaries Typically, couples manage their joint accounts in one of these ways: You can maximise the interest earned with your personal Multiplier Account. Here's how it works: Bank your salaries into a joint account such as My Account to qualify for higher eligible transaction tiers and earn bonus interest on the average daily balance in your individual DBS Multiplier Account. Here’s  an example on how a joint account can benefit you: Scenario 1: Both John and Mary credit their salaries and dividends into a joint account. They also have a personal Multiplier Account each. In this scenario, the bonus interest earned on their individual Multiplier Account will be based on the combined credited salaries and dividends ($7,100), instead of just their individual salary and dividends. Scenario 2:  Both George and Emily have a personal Multiplier Account each. Only George credits his salary into a joint account. In this scenario, the bonus interest earned on their individual Multiplier Account will be based on George’s credited salary ($4,000). Even though Emily does not draw a salary, she still gets to enjoy the bonus interest in her personal Multiplier Account.  You can still benefit even if you're a gig economy worker or are in-between jobs. Here's how: 2. Get more out of your spending with Multiplier Starting a life together is likely to lead to additional payments, premiums, and overall costs. This includes life insurance, mortgage payments, utilities, and groceries, among others. Make the most of these expenses through the Multiplier account.  With the DBS Multiplier, qualifying payments and purchases in the relevant categories can help to earn bonus interest of up to 4.1% p.a.. These categories include credit cards/PayLah! retail spending, instalment payments for a DBS/POSB home loan, as well as selected insurance and investment products. You can also use the interest calculator to get an estimate on the interest could earn each year. Read more: How can Multiplier work for you if you are in your 30s?\n",

Plan better for your life together Money can be a major source of conflict between couples - having a joint account creates transparency (and builds trust), while helping you and your partner grow your little nest egg. In addition, setting couple goals create financial discipline, encouraging you to work within your budgets and save for something much bigger like a new house, the bucket list vacation in Machu Picchu, or more tuition classes for the kids as their major exams approach.

      "3 reasons why you should register your NRIC for PayNow From paying for your hawker meals, settling of bills and tuition fees to transferring money to your friends, PayNow has added newfound convenience to our lives. And if you are a PayNow user, and haven’t registered for PayNow with your NRIC, here are 3 things you are missing out on. (P.S.: Yes, this is different from registering your mobile number!) What are you missing out without registering your NRIC for PayNow? 1. Enjoy quicker payout from government initiatives  From time to time, our government carries out initiatives, such as care and support schemes, to redistribute wealth among Singaporeans. Case in point is when it rolled out four Budgets in 2020, which came with multiple cash payouts, like the GST Voucher and one-off Care and Support cash payout, to help Singaporeans tide over the challenging year due to COVID-19. If you had registered your NRIC with PayNow, you would be given priority and gotten those payouts earlier than those who were using other modes of credit that might take them another one to two weeks to receive. 2. Receive payment from companies and organisations in less time  Ever experienced the lengthy wait for companies to disburse a payment via cheque to you, and then go through the hassle of making a trip down to the branch to deposit it? And, don’t forget the time needed for the cheque to clear! Whether you are making a travel claim or looking to receive your savings plan payout from your insurer, it is not uncommon that the payment process may span a long time when you select the cheque option. You may like to know that the government isn’t the only organisation that is leveraging PayNow for quick payments. Many private companies and selected business entities are also onboarded to PayNow. Register your NRIC for PayNow and say hello to more convenience. 3. Future perks and convenience when more services adopt PayNow  PayNow was introduced as a peer-to-peer fund transfer service to encourage digital payments amongst Singaporeans. It has since evolved into a digital payment tool for businesses with the launch of PayNow Corporate, where some companies even pay salary to their employees via PayNow. Signing up for PayNow today will prepare you for the future perks and conveniences that come with PayNow. Register now How do I register my NRIC to PayNow?

      "6 online banking safety tips  If you’ve only got a minute:  Technology has brought the world to our fingertips. From small, day-to-day transactions like ordering food, to larger ones like booking flights or hotels for an upcoming trip, all these can easily be done with a few taps on a screen! However, with this added convenience brings a new set of risks, which is why it is paramount to adopt good security practices so that we do not fall prey to cyber-attacks. While the bank proactively predicts, prevents, detects, and responds to cybersecurity threats, here are 5 ways to keep yourself protected. 1. Secure your access on wireless networks It is common to tap public Wi-Fi networks when you’re out and about, especially when you are overseas. However, doing so puts you at a higher risk of being a target of cyber-crime as public Wi-Fi networks are often unsecured. Cyber-criminals can steal your personal information or passwords, or even download malware or ransomware into your devices. This is why when it comes to online banking or transactions that require you to key in sensitive information, opt to use secured Wi-Fi networks that require a password or mobile data instead. Otherwise, just stick to browsing the internet and refrain from logging into any accounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before using public Wi-Fi, it is also good practice to verify that the network you are connecting to is legitimate. Use a VPN where possible and opt to “Forget This Network” when you have finished using it. You should also ensure your computer software is up to date, your data is backed up, and be extra vigilant when clicking on any links.  2. Set up 2FA By now, most of us would be familiar with the prompt to “approve” log-ins to government services and portals through our Singpass app along with needing to key in a one-time-pin (OTP) to authenticate online payment transactions with our debit/credit cards. 2FA is a method of authentication that requires users to provide 2 forms of identification before access to a system or service is granted. This additional layer of protection reduces the risk associated with stolen or compromised passwords. When it comes to banking transactions, the digital token is used to provide 2FA and is included as a feature within your digibank app.  Convenient Digital tokens are built into your digibank mobile app, providing a more seamless and secured authentication journey for your online transactions. Authentication is done with a tap of your Digital Token while mobile banking transactions are authenticated in the background. You no longer have to wait for SMS OTPs or look for your physical token. If an OTP is required, the digital token generates one almost instantly, making authentication quicker than if you had done so with an SMS or email OTP. Secure Traditional SMS OTPs can be intercepted even before they reach you! And this is one of many ways savvy cyber-criminals use to commit fraud. Using a digital token minimises the risk of this as authentication is done directly through digibank. Each authentication request sent and received via the digital token is encrypted, making it much harder for cyber criminals to intercept the process and illicitly access your money. Besides this, the digibank app can only be registered to and used on one mobile device – yours. Easy to set up and use The set up of your digital token is easy. It only takes 3 simple steps where you will need your mobile device and a bank-registered email address. Remember to enable push notifications for your digibank app on your mobile device. To authenticate a banking transaction, simply tap on the pop-up notification that appears and you will be redirected to the digibank app to approve or reject your transaction. Never approve transactions if they are not initiated by you. Always check the message prompts to ensure that the details of the transaction are accurate before approving it. Find out more about: DBS digibank – the smartest way to bank  3. Change your PIN and password regularly With cyber-crime on the rise, usernames and passwords are becoming increasingly vulnerable to a variety of attack methods. Changing your Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) and passwords regularly can reduce the risk of your password and account being compromised. Besides this, it is important to set a strong password – one that you can memorise easily so as not to get locked out of your accounts, but not easily enough for hackers to guess. Avoid common and weak passwords  Avoid repeating passwords across accounts As much as possible, avoid using the same password for different accounts. If your email password is also your banking PIN number, the hacker who cracks one of your accounts will get a 2-for-1 access (in some cases, more). Setting a strong password Using randomly generated passwords like “@#37KTmm-Y2%” may seem like the most secure option, but it is nearly impossible to remember it without writing it down (which would defeat the purpose of password security).  Use biometric authentication Depending on your mobile device, technologies such as fingerprint and facial recognition can help authenticate you securely. 4. Be wary of “important notices” While previously easily identifiable through questionable grammar and flashing headlines, phishing scams have increased in sophistication. If you’ve received emails purportedly from your bank asking you to login to your account, here are some basic precautions to take. A healthy dose of scepticism will protect you – if an offer sounds too good to be true, it probably is. If still in doubt, contact your bank or supposed sender directly to confirm that the communication came from them. Read more: #BSHARP Protect yourself online 5. Set transaction limits and alerts A lower daily limit for transactions will cap your potential losses in the event that your account is compromised. You can set the threshold amount for transfers to other bank accounts (DBS/POSB or not), overseas accounts, and credit card transactions, among others. This can be done easily via the digibank app, or online banking. DBS will send you an SMS alert if there are any suspicious transactions on your account. These include transactions of an unusually large sum or unexpected overseas payments performed digitally. You can also customise your own notification alerts based on your preferred transaction threshold. If you receive an alert for a transaction that was not performed by you, call the bank immediately to stop it from going through.  6. Stay up-to-date Make it a habit to know your bank balance and check it regularly. If you spot any irregularities with your bank balance or in your e-statement, contact the bank immediately. Only install DBS’s mobile applications from the official Google Play Store, Huawei AppGallery, or Apple App Store to ensure that your application is legitimate. Enable auto updates so that you always have the latest version of the app. If you notice anything amiss with your online banking experience, call us at 1800 339 6963 or (65) 6339 6963 from overseas at once.

      "How to stay protected from online scams  If you've only got a minute:  Received an SMS from a bank asking you to click on a link, which then takes you to a webpage that requires you to key in your login details? There’s a possibility that it’s a phishing scam. The number of phishing scams in Singapore hit 8,500 in 2022, more than twice the number in 2021, with more than 80% spoofing a bank or financial service, according to the Cyber Security Agency (CSA). In Singapore, millions of dollars have been lost to scammers in recent years, with the victims coming from all walks of life from retirees to millennials. In fact, 51% of scam victims in 2023 were young adults between the ages of 20 and 39. This is why it is important to understand how online scams generally work as it will allow you to spot some key tell-tale signs. That way, you are better prepared to protect yourself against them. What are phishing scams? Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where scammers pose as legitimate institutions and individuals through websites, messaging platforms, and social media, with the aim of obtaining sensitive personal information from targeted individuals. The type of information they try to obtain includes your NRIC, name, date of birth and email, usernames and passwords, bank account details and even credit card numbers. With it, they can access your account to try to steal your money or identity. Common ways phishing scams work It’s important to identify the tell-tale signs of phishing scams to prevent becoming a victim. Phishing often relies on catching your attention through an emotional response, such as fear, curiosity, or a desire for a good deal on products or services. Over the years, phishing scams have become more sophisticated. In the past, it would be easy to spot spelling errors and typos on fake websites. But these days, they often look identical to official ones and have URLs that can appear close to the legitimate webpage’s URL. QR codes or short links are also used to trick you into visiting phishing websites. Phishing can also be done using an International Domain Name (IDN) homograph attack. This allows the scammer to set up a fake webpage that shows the correct address — with the secured connection lock in the browser bar — but leads you elsewhere. Social media and messaging apps are also rife with phishing. Watch out for fake accounts that respond to customers who ask for help on brands’ social media accounts. Advertisements or online marketplaces for products and services on social media or search engines could also be phishing in disguise. The scammer may interact with you personally to lower your guard before asking you to visit a link or download an app. Be careful of what information you post on your public profile too as it allows for scammers to create personalised phishing attacks. They could even use an account they’ve broken into to continue existing messages or threads to increase the believability of their requests to you. That’s how phishing emails can infiltrate ongoing email threads, leading you to inadvertently click on a link thinking it’s from a colleague and your computer starts downloading all sorts of malware and spyware. When it comes to payments, always verify payment requests and confirm their authenticity through direct contact with the service provider.  How to prevent phishing scams Here are some tips to shield yourself from being scammed: Protect yourself Protect your devices How not to fall for common credit card scams Apart from gaining your password and personal particulars, scammers can also obtain your credit and debit card details. Card security can be compromised in several ways during travel and online shopping.     When travelling Don’t use unsecured public Wi-Fi networks. These networks are often targeted by cybercriminals who can intercept data transmitted between your device and the websites you visit, potentially gaining access to your credit card information when you make online purchases or check your bank account. Deceptive ATMs or point-of-sale terminals may be rigged with card skimmers. These devices record card details, so that when you use them, criminals can steal your card data without your knowledge. When online shopping Scammers sometimes send enticing offers via email or create fake e-commerce websites that mimic legitimate ones, luring shoppers to input their card information. And before you know it, your next credit card bill comes with a shocking amount not made by you. Even if you don’t fall for a fake website or click a suspicious link, your stored card details on a merchant’s site may be compromised if the merchant gets hacked. We’ve all heard about how the personal details of consumers have been leaked online in several hacking cases.  Implementing Payment Controls Fortunately, there are safeguards and measures you can take to better protect your card with DBS Payment Controls. Here are 3 examples of card controls that you can implement. 1) Lock/unlock your Debit/Credit Card temporarily You can do this immediately if you suspect you’ve clicked on a phishing link or misplaced your card. By temporarily locking your card, you can still unlock it at a later date and continue using your card, unlike blocking your card entirely, which renders it unusable. 2) Disable online transactions If you decide not to use a particular card for a while due to a change in lifestyle you can activate this feature to ensure that no transactions can be made. 3) Disable the overseas transaction function Disable this function when not travelling so that if your card falls into the wrong hands overseas, no one can use it to make purchases.  Access Payment Controls Payment Controls also lets you disable cash advance transactions and set a monthly spend limit each billing cycle, so in the event your card falls into the wrong hands, a scammer won’t be able to use your card for unauthorised transactions. Step 1: Log on to your DBS digibank mobile app Step 2: Click on More Step 3: Under Manage Cards & Loans, select Payment Controls Step 4: Select the Card you wish to customise and toggle switch on/off In doing so, you reduce your risk of falling prey to scams. About 40% of the customers who called in about fraud disputes had no active Payment Controls and were between the ages of 26 to 40. Stay informed and protected Not sure if something is a scam?

Changing your mobile number Our mobile phones (and numbers) are inextricably linked to our lives today. We use it not only for communication, but also to receive banking alerts, OTPs, and even money transfers, among others. Thus, it is vital for us to ensure that some key steps are taken when changing our phone number. 1. Sync and store your contact list to avoid data loss Have your contact list stored in at least 2 places in case one does not work out (i.e. sync it to a cloud and store a copy of it in your mobile/SIM card). 2. Update your key service providers Nowadays, many service providers choose to contact you or send updates through text alerts instead of email. Update your mobile number with them to ensure you don’t miss out on important messages. Some key ones are: Banks also use your mobile number for payment functions and to alert you on any suspicious transactions or movements in your accounts. So, update it the moment you get your new one working.  3. Delink your old mobile phone number Once you have updated your bank records, your old mobile number will automatically be de-registered from the linked services. This may not be the case for other platforms or e-wallets so remember to delink your mobile number where applicable. If your old mobile number is not delinked and it gets recycled to another user, you face 3 main risks.   i) Losing money or personal information This can happen if someone transfers money or sends private information to your old mobile without knowing it has been changed. ii) Disruption of services or late deliveries For ride share services or memberships with rewards, change your phone number from within the app. Setting up a whole new account will mean losing any accumulated rewards you may have. iii) Risk of getting locked out of your accounts Email, social media, and online shopping accounts are often linked to your phone number. If you lose your password, your phone number may be required to reset it. Often, this involves an OTP that is sent to your mobile number as a secondary authentication. Updating your number on these accounts beforehand will save you from getting locked out in instances like these.   4. Update your contacts It is common to send a mass message to update your contacts with your new number. When doing so, keep in mind to draft a message that won’t seem like it was sent by a scammer or phishing bot.  In summary Using our mobile phones and apps can save us precious time and allow us to go cashless when running errands – which is not only more hygienic but also more convenient. However, it can prove costly if these fall into the wrong hands. It’s always better to be safe than sorry and maintain good digital habits. Ready to start?

      "Tips to prevent cyberbullying in Singapore In today’s connected world, we depend on the web for most of our information, download apps on our smartphones and tablets to watch movies, and turn to online social platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp to connect with people and chat with friends and family. The online world is a double-edged sword. Its advantages are undeniable — with just a few simple clicks, you get access to a wealth of information, and the ability to instantly connect with loved ones and people from anywhere in the world 24/7. But there are cyber risks that can be a danger to you and your loved ones. In a 2018 study done by Mediacorp programme Talking Point found that three-quarters of children and teenagers surveyed in Singapore said that they have been bullied online. However, what is most worrying is that almost all of them did not inform their parents. That is why, as parents, it is important to know what cyber bullying is and to learn about cyber security. Read on for some cyber security tips. Recognise how cyber safety can be compromised What is cyberbullying? Cyber bullying is a form of bullying that happens electronically or online. While children are especially vulnerable to risks that come with early access to the internet and social media, older kids and teens are not spared – according to a 2014 survey by the Singapore Children’s Society and the Institute of Mental Health, one in nine adolescents have been subjected to some form of cyber bullying or online harassment in Singapore.  What is online harassment? Online harassment is defined as behaviour towards a person that results in emotional and mental stress and suffering. These types of behaviour include threatening or abusive communication, acts that cause fear or provocation of violence, and unlawful stalking. Earlier this year, the Parliament of Singapore updated the Protection of Harassment Act (Poha) to streamline procedures for online bullying and harassment, as well as to tackle offences such as doxing – publishing of information about someone’s identity that puts the victim at risk of serious harm to their reputation or safety. What is identity theft? Identity theft happens when someone uses someone else’s identity deliberately, usually for financial gain and other benefits, or to the victim’s disadvantage. Teens are more susceptible to identity theft than any other age group as they are more likely to share their personal information online and are less cautious when it comes to ensure the necessary steps are taken to safeguard cyber security. This means that your job as a parent is even more important when keeping an eye out for your child for any suspicious activity! Additionally, teenagers might click on phishing emails which could result in their account being compromised and personal information accessed. They could also be unknowingly sharing sensitive information on social media to strangers with ill intentions. Recognising what is identity theft can help you keep your loved ones safe. How to prevent cyber bullying Tip 1: Awareness is key  Familiarising yourself with cyber bullying and other cybercrimes such as the two common issues mentioned above can help you deal with potential cyber risks your teen may be exposed to, and help you find ways on how to protect yourself from cyber bullying. Cyber bullying comes in many forms, from flaming to outing to exclusion and even identity theft, and is considered a form of online harassment. Online harassment involves emails and messages of online entries that aim to hurt or put the victim at a disadvantage. In the same Talking Point survey, teens cited the three most common types of cyber bullying: posting an embarrassing video of them online; calling them a negative name; and posting embarrassing comments about them, all of which can cause negative emotional and psychological effects. Always be on the lookout for warning signals such as behavioural changes and discuss these concerns with your child. These can range from loss of confidence, becoming reclusive, shifts in eating or sleeping patterns, and refusing to go to school. Tip 2: Set guidelines for their online interactions Similar to monitoring your teen’s real life social interactions by placing rules and restrictions on where and when they go, who they meet and what they do, set similar guidelines for their online interactions as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "It helps to build a good relationship with your teen where they can have a safe space for open conversations. This will make it easier for them to share their thoughts and feelings, and whatever they may be going through. Develop and encourage a deeper connection with your teen by talking to them regularly and explaining the reasons behind certain decisions. This may help facilitate understanding of your intent, making it easier for them to accept your decisions. Your teen will likely respect and stick with mutually agreed limitations. Tip 3: Educate them on cyber safety tips  Educating them about the risks that they may face on the internet can go a long way in ensuring their cyber safety. Teach them how to be responsible internet users, what should they do if they are being cyber bullied or if their identity is stolen, and give them cyber bullying and identity theft examples so that they may be more vigilant in their cyber interactions. And always ensure that they can approach you when they need help – most teens refrain from telling their parents about cyber harassment fearing that their parents would limit their access to their mobile devices and other gadgets. Maintaining an open non-judgmental communication channel is very important as our children navigate this digital world. Tip 4: Don’t be afraid to report cyber bullying in Singapore  There are many resources available, such as trauma counselling, I.T. support and legal advice, should you or a loved one fall victim to cybercrime. Governments across the world have started taking notice of cyber bullying and related crimes. If you are wondering what should you do if you are being cyber bullied, you should know that law enforcement agencies, especially in Singapore, are extremely efficient and can offer assistance and guidance. There are also counselling programmes led by specialists and tailored for cyber-related crimes that can help victims recover from the associated mental trauma. Tip 5: Get protection: Why cyber insurance is important  Prevention is always better than cure. Teenagers’ exposure to the Internet and social media increases the chances of falling victim to cyberbullying and cybercrimes that are likely to bring about detrimental consequences, both financial and emotional.  To sum up, there are many ways to seek advice and assistance when things get out of hand or cannot be resolved. It is always advisable to act on it early to prevent it from escalating to a point where it is harder to resolve. Remind your loved ones not to hesitate to reach out to those who are trustworthy, and remember that help is available. The online world can be a great place of fun and knowledge as long as we put adequate safeguards in place in order to enjoy it to the fullest.

      "6 benefits of going cashless When you think of going “cashless”, credit cards may be the first thing that comes to mind. You aren’t wrong – this idea of going cashless with cards came about in 1950 when businessman Frank McNamara dined a restaurant only to find out he had left his wallet at home. He promised the restaurant to repay the bill by signing that he would do so the next day. This brought about the invention of the first Diner’s Club multipurpose charge card which was made from cardboard. The credit card as we know it today is only one of the many cashless payment methods available to us. In recent years, we have seen the rise of cashless payment methods including PayNow and QR code payments through mobile wallets like DBS PayLah! The transition to a cashless society was accelerated during the Covid-19 pandemic, when going cashless was encouraged to minimise physical contact and the spread of germs between persons. Today, going out without our wallet will no longer leave us in hot soup – especially if we have our phones with us. Yet, many of us still have reservations on going cashless. Here are 6 reasons for you to consider on joining the journey to a cashless society. Security How many times have we gone to the ATM to withdraw cash only to look over our shoulder to ensure there are no shady characters lingering around? The availability of digital payment modes has made it unnecessary for us to carry large amounts of cash around, reducing the likelihood of opening ourselves to being a target to robbers. Convenience While it is often said that “Singaporeans love to queue lah”, who wouldn’t like to save some time on waiting in line – especially for cash withdrawals at bank ATMs and branches? Digital payment options have eliminated the need for physical cash or even physical presence to facilitate transactions for your convenience. No cash to buy your afternoon kopi? No worries – DBS PayLah! to the rescue. Need to go CNY shopping for new clothes online? No problem – do so from the comfort of home and at any time of day with digital payment options. With the DBS Visa Debit Card, you can even pay for your overseas purchases in up to 11 foreign currencies with no foreign exchange fees. Better financial planning As the saying goes, “cash is king”. But in 2023, is it still? With a rising focus on responsible budgeting and financial planning, physical cash makes for a medium that is difficult to track. In contrast, cashless payments can be easily monitored, and spending habits tracked. No more wondering how your cash “mysteriously” disappears through the day – just retrieve your transaction histories and credit card bills through your digibank app and put on your Sherlock Holmes cap to track down your expenses and monetary habits. You can also engage with the financial planning tool DBS NAV Planner which will help piece together your financial habits, gain clarity on your financial wellness and close money gaps. Hygiene Given the increasing number of bank notes in circulation with each passing year, it is no surprise that money is changing hands more and more, collecting on its surface a plethora of unspeakable things along the way. While it is common knowledge that physical currency is laden with germs, do you know how dirty your money really is? Based on a study done by CNA Insider1 in 2017 which tested the bacteria count on notes collected from different venues across Singapore, the average bacteria count ranges from <50 per note (in ATMs) to >48,000 per note (in wet markets). This is comparable to the amount of bacteria found on toilet seats and even the sole of your shoe1! Most of us would not willingly handle the sole of our shoes daily. In the same way, by not handling cash, you can choose to be digitally rich instead of “filthy rich”! Sustainability The Monetary Authority of Singapore stated that approximately 100 million pieces of new notes are issued each year2, much of which must be destroyed later as it “far exceeds normal circulation demand”. The currency we use cannot be easily incinerated as it is made of polymer derived from petroleum and coated with multiple layers of materials3. Not only the destruction, but the production and transportation of physical cash also produce carbon emissions which have a negative impact on our environment. With the convenient array of digital payment options, we too, can play a part in healing our environment. Discounts and savings Using digital payments comes with its unique set of perks such as rewards points, cash rebates or other loyalty benefits. If you are using credit cards, you can also chalk up miles through spending on the relevant cards. Often, card and e-payment companies have tie ups with merchants to offer extra discounts or 1-for-1 deals. DBS digital solutions for your everyday needs Ready to join the cashless movement and reap the benefits mentioned above? Here are 5 ways you can implement digital solutions in your daily life.
